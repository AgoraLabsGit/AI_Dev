- **Development Dashboard**: Visual interface at `/dev/monitor`

### 🔷 **AVCA Services Monitored**
- **AI Client Service**: Multi-path analysis, token tracking, API calls
- **Blueprint Service**: Blueprint generation and validation 
- **Source Analyzer**: Repository and code analysis (integrated)
- **Document Generator**: Document creation processes (integrated)
- **Migration Service**: Migration planning and analysis (integrated)

### 🧠 **DIAS Services Monitored**
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Pattern analysis and insights
- **Framework Detector**: Framework identification (integrated)
- **Learning System**: Pattern learning and optimization (integrated)
- **Event Handling System**: Event processing and routing (integrated)

### 🔗 **Integration Layer Monitored**

- **Performance Monitor**: Metrics collection and analysis (integrated)

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Development Mode (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start development with monitoring
npm run dev

# The monitoring system auto-activates in development mode
# You'll see color-coded logs in your terminal:
# 🔷 AVCA operations (Blue)
# 🧠 DIAS intelligence (Green) 
# 🔗 Integration layer (Purple)
```

### 2. **Visual Dashboard**
```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to monitoring dashboard
http://localhost:3000/dev/monitor
```

### 3. **Test Monitoring System**
```bash
# Test with example operations
npm run test:logic-monitor

# Test with actual Vibe Lab services  
npm run test:vibe-lab-monitor
```

### 4. **Enhanced Development**
```bash
# Start with monitoring initialization messages
npm run dev:monitor
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### **Console Output**
```
[2024-01-15 10:23:45.123] [AVCA:AI-CLIENT] 🔷 Analyzing input: type=fresh, project=SaaS
