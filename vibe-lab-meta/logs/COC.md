# Continuity of Context - Vibe Lab AVCA-DIAS

## Current Status (January 28, 2025)
- **Phase**: 1 - Foundation Enhancement
- **Progress**: 60% Complete (3/5 tasks)
- **Last Completed**: AVCA-002 Stage 3 (Advanced Context Management)
- **Active Task**: None (preparing for DIAS-001)

## Recent Achievements
1. ✅ AVCA-002 Complete (All 3 Stages):
   - Stage 1: AI Client base implementation
   - Stage 2: Rate limiting & retry logic
   - Stage 3: Advanced context management
2. Added comprehensive testing to all components
3. Achieved 85%+ test coverage
4. Performance: <2ms context preparation

## Architecture State
```
vibe-lab-product/lib/avca/
├── services/           ✅ All core services implemented
├── types.ts           ✅ Type definitions
├── token-tracking.ts  ✅ Cost monitoring
├── model-config.ts    ✅ Model selection
└── [test scripts]     ✅ Comprehensive testing
```

## Key Technical Decisions
- LRU cache with 5-minute TTL for context
- tiktoken for accurate token counting
- Priority-based sliding windows
- Token bucket rate limiting
- Circuit breaker at 5 failures

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate**: Begin DIAS-001 (Event System Foundation)
   - Event definitions for component lifecycle
   - Event handlers for AVCA pipeline
   - Dead letter queue implementation
   - Event storage for audit trail

2. **This Week**: Complete Phase 1
   - DIAS-001: 12h estimate
   - INT-001: 8h estimate
   - Phase 1 hardening sprint

## Testing Status
- Unit tests: ✅ Implemented for all components
- Integration tests: ✅ Service boundaries tested
- Performance tests: ✅ Sub-2ms averages
- Coverage: 85%+ achieved
- CI/CD: ⏳ Pending (Phase 1 hardening)

## Risks & Blockers
- None currently blocking progress
- Compression algorithm needs optimization (low priority)

## For Next Session
- Read this document first
- Check git status for any uncommitted changes
- Begin with DIAS-001 implementation
- Focus on event-driven architecture patterns
