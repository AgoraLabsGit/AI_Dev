**Security Patterns, Compliance, and Best Practices**
<!-- AI Genesis Guide: Ask the user about the application's security and compliance requirements. -->

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [AI: Ask the user about their authentication strategy (e.g., simple email/password, social logins, MFA).]

## 2. Data Security
- **Input Validation**: [AI: State that all user input will be validated and sanitized by default.]
- **PII Handling**: [AI: Ask if the application will handle sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and if there are specific requirements (e.g., encryption at rest).]

## 3. Dependencies
- [AI: Inform the user that automated dependency scanning will be set up to check for vulnerabilities.]

## 4. Compliance
- [AI: Ask if the project must adhere to any regulatory standards like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.]
