# AVCA-DIAS Continuity of Context

## Project Overview
AVCA-DIAS is a clean, reusable system for AI-verified component architecture and dynamic intelligence adaptation. This system is being built through the meta-process of developing Vibe Lab.

## Current Context

### Project State
- **Phase**: Phase 1 In Progress (AVCA-001 ✅)
- **Progress**: 15% (1.2/8 phases) - Microservices foundation complete
- **Location**: Building in `vibe-lab-product/lib/`
- **Next**: AVCA-002 (AI Client with rate limiting)

### Latest Achievement
- **Phase 1 Start**: Microservices architecture implemented
- **AVCA-001**: ✅ Complete in 4h (vs 20h estimate)
- **Efficiency**: 5x faster than planned
- **Quality**: All tests passing, architecture validated

### Active Development
- **Current Focus**: Phase 1 - Foundation Enhancement
- **Completed**: Base service, Event bus, Service registry, Blueprint service
- **Branch**: main
- **Dependencies**: Microservices foundation ready for AI client

### Implementation Strategy
1. ✅ Phase 0: Minimal vertical slice validated
2. ✅ Cost optimization: Model selection implemented
3. 🚧 Phase 1: Microservices architecture (in progress)
4. ⏳ Phase 2-8: Full system implementation

### Phase 1 Progress
**AVCA-001 Complete** (4 hours):
- ✅ Base Service abstraction
- ✅ Event Bus (pub/sub, retry, DLQ)
- ✅ Service Registry (discovery, health)
- ✅ Blueprint Service (example)
- ✅ Microservices test passing

**Architecture Features**:
- Health monitoring with auto-deregister
- Message retry with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed messages
- Round-robin load balancing
- Metrics collection per service

### Key Decisions
1. ✅ Multi-model approach (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
2. ✅ Token optimization (40% reduction)
3. ✅ Event-driven microservices
4. ✅ Base service pattern for consistency
5. ✅ Health checks mandatory

## Next Actions
1. AVCA-002: AI Client Implementation (16h)
2. DIAS-001: Event System Foundation (12h)
3. INT-001: Integration Layer (8h)
4. Complete Phase 1 by Feb 2

## Recent Changes
- Started Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
- Completed AVCA-001 in record time (4h vs 20h)
- Implemented full microservices architecture
- Created event bus with advanced features
- All tests passing, ready for AI client
