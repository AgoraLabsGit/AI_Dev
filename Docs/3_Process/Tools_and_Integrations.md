# Tools and Integrations

**Document Type**: Process & Standards
**Status**: Authoritative
**Purpose**: This document outlines the key tools and external integrations that are essential to the Vibe Lab development workflow. These tools are used to manage tasks, assist in development, and interact with various external systems.

---

## 1. Task Master

`task-master` is our official command-line tool for breaking down high-level roadmaps into detailed, actionable tasks. It provides a structured way to manage project execution.

*   **Purpose**: Task creation, management, and tracking.
*   **Initialization**: The tool should be initialized once at the root of the `vibe-lab-product` directory.
*   **Command**:
    ```bash
    task-master init -n "Vibe Lab" -d "AI-driven development platform" -a "Mike" --no-aliases --git-tasks -r cursor
    ```

## 2. SuperClaude (AI Assistant)

"SuperClaude" is the integrated AI development assistant (me) responsible for executing development tasks within this environment.

*   **Purpose**: Code generation, analysis, refactoring, and process automation.
*   **Capabilities**:
    *   Interacting with the codebase (reading, writing, searching).
    *   Executing terminal commands, including `task-master`.
    *   Maintaining key process documents like `Continuity_of_Context.md` and `Development_Log.md`.
    *   Following the principles outlined in `AI_Operating_Principles.md`.

## 3. WebTools (Future Implementation)

This will be a suite of web-based utilities for monitoring and interacting with the Vibe Lab system, especially for viewing data that is difficult to represent in the terminal.

*   **Examples**:
    *   A UI for viewing server-side error logs.
    *   A dashboard for Vibe Lab Intelligence monitoring.

## 4. MCP Tools (Future Implementation)

This will be a set of tools for managing the "Magic Component Pipeline" (MCP), which is used for generating component variations at scale.

## 5. External Libraries & Resources (Future Implementation)

This will cover our strategy for interacting with external resources, such as component libraries, GitHub repositories, and other online documentation, as part of the `Context7` intelligence server's capabilities.
