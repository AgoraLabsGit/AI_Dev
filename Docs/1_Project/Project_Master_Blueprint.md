# 01 - Vibe Lab Product Master Blueprint
**Business Context, Requirements, and Roadmap**

---

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

### Vision
Transform software development through an intelligent, Strike-inspired multi-agent platform that guides developers through a strategic, AI-powered lifecycle: **Design → Build → Iterate**.

The platform serves as an AI co-pilot that transforms high-level concepts into production-ready codebases through AVCA (AI-guided Visual Component Architecture) and DIAS (Development Intelligence Analysis System).

### Business Goals
1. **Accelerate Development**: Reduce project setup and component creation time by 80%
2. **Improve Code Quality**: Maintain 95%+ architecture compliance through AI auditing
3. **Enable Non-Developers**: Allow business stakeholders to participate in technical planning
4. **Market Leadership**: Become the standard for AI-assisted software architecture

### Success Metrics
- **10,000 active monthly users** by end of year
- **90%+ blueprint-to-deployment success rate**
- **<5 second** response time for AI-powered features
- **8.5/10+ user satisfaction** with AI assistance quality

## 2. The Core Outputs: Overview & Specifications

The "Design" phase of the Vibe Lab lifecycle produces two distinct and critical documents:

*   **Project Overview**: A high-level, human-centric document that captures the project's vision, goals, and user stories. This is generated through the initial conversational AI process in the `/onboarding` flow.
*   **Build Specifications**: A detailed, technical document that defines the project's tech stack, component architecture, and the foundational rules for the AVCA pipeline. This is created and managed in the `/plan` flow, using the Blueprint Editor.

These two documents form the complete "blueprint" for the project and are the foundation for the "Build" and "Iterate" phases.

- **Technical Founders**: Non-developers who need to communicate with developers

### Secondary Users
- **Enterprise Development Teams**: Looking for standardized architecture
- **Agencies**: Building multiple client projects with consistent quality
- **Educators**: Teaching software architecture and best practices
