## ðŸ¤– **Ongoing DIAS Intelligence - Post-Onboarding Support**

### **Chat-Based Component Recommendations**
```typescript
interface OngoingDIASSupport {
  contextAwareness: {
    currentProject: "Knows user's existing components and template style",
    usagePatterns: "Learns from user's component usage and preferences", 
    projectHistory: "Understands user's development patterns and goals",
    teamCollaboration: "Aware of team component selections and standards"
  },
  
  featureRequestAnalysis: {
    intentRecognition: "Analyze user's feature requests in natural language",
    componentMapping: "Map requests to existing template components",
    gapIdentification: "Identify when new components are needed vs existing ones",
    implementationSuggestions: "Provide step-by-step component integration guidance"
  },
  
  intelligentRecommendations: {
    existingComponentSuggestions: "Recommend components from user's selected template",
    configurationGuidance: "Help configure recommended components for specific needs",
    integrationAssistance: "Guide integration with existing components",
    optimizationSuggestions: "Suggest improvements to current component usage"
  }
}
```

### **Example Chat DIAS Interactions**

#### **Scenario 1: Adding New Features**
```typescript
const chatInteraction1 = {
  userMessage: "I want to add user profile management to my app",
  
  diasAnalysis: {
    currentContext: {
      existingComponents: ["DashboardLayout", "UserTable", "AuthForms"],
      selectedTemplate: "Linear Style",
      databaseSchema: "users table with profile fields detected"
    },
    
    patternRecognition: "USER_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT pattern detected",
    
    recommendations: [
      {
        component: "UserProfileForm",
        rationale: "Matches your Linear template style and existing user schema",
        configuration: "Auto-configured for your users table fields",
        integration: "Integrates with your existing AuthForms component"
      },
      {
        component: "ProfileImageUpload", 
        rationale: "Complements profile management with avatar functionality",
        configuration: "Configured for your file storage setup",
        integration: "Works with UserProfileForm component"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  diasResponse: "I can help you add user profile management! Based on your Linear-style app with existing user authentication, I recommend the **UserProfileForm** component. It's already configured for your users table and will match your existing design. Should I also suggest the **ProfileImageUpload** component for avatar functionality?"
}
```

#### **Scenario 2: Improving Existing Features**
```typescript
const chatInteraction2 = {
  userMessage: "My user table is slow with lots of data, how can I improve it?",
  
  diasAnalysis: {
    currentContext: {
      existingComponents: ["UserTable with basic pagination"],
      performanceData: "Slow loading detected with 10k+ records",
      selectedTemplate: "Linear Style"
    },
    
    optimizationOpportunities: [
      "Advanced pagination with virtual scrolling",
      "Search and filtering capabilities", 
      "Bulk actions for efficiency"
    ],
    
    recommendations: [
      {
        component: "VirtualizedDataTable",
        rationale: "Handles large datasets efficiently",
        upgrade: "Drop-in replacement for your current UserTable"
      },
      {
        component: "AdvancedSearchFilters",
        rationale: "Reduces data load by filtering on server side",
        integration: "Works with VirtualizedDataTable component"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  diasResponse: "I see your UserTable is handling 10k+ records. I recommend upgrading to the **VirtualizedDataTable** component - it's a drop-in replacement that handles large datasets much better. I can also add **AdvancedSearchFilters** to reduce server load. Want me to configure these for your Linear template style?"
}
```

#### **Scenario 3: Feature Gap Analysis**
```typescript
const chatInteraction3 = {
  userMessage: "I need real-time notifications for my dashboard",
  
  diasAnalysis: {
    currentContext: {
      existingComponents: ["DashboardLayout", "UserTable", "MetricsCards"],
      selectedTemplate: "Linear Style",
      missingCapability: "Real-time notifications"
    },
    
    gapAnalysis: "No notification components in current selection",
    
    recommendations: [
      {
        component: "NotificationCenter",
        rationale: "Provides comprehensive notification management",
        newFeature: true,
        configuration: "Styled for Linear template with dark theme"
      },
      {
        component: "ToastNotifications",
        rationale: "Provides immediate user feedback",
        complementary: true,
        integration: "Works with NotificationCenter for complete solution"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  diasResponse: "Your current dashboard doesn't have notification components yet. I recommend adding the **NotificationCenter** component to your sidebar and **ToastNotifications** for immediate alerts. Both are styled for your Linear template. Should I configure these with your existing user system?"
}
```
