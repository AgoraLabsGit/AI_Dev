# 09 - AI Integration Architecture

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27

## 1. Core Principles - Phased AI Collaboration System

### **Phase 1: Dual-Claude Foundation (MVP)**
- **Independent Dual Perspectives**: Two separate Claude Code instances with completely isolated context windows - **Claude Developer** (implementation focus) and **Claude Auditor** (fresh review perspective). This ensures independent problem-solving capabilities without context contamination.

- **Context Isolation Architecture**: Strict separation of knowledge and perspective between instances prevents bias and enables true independent validation. The Auditor approaches code with "fresh eyes" for objective quality assessment.

- **SuperClaude Feature Consistency**: Both instances leverage full SuperClaude capabilities (MCP, TaskMaster, wave orchestration, personas) for maximum productivity and feature parity.

- **Wide Context Window Utilization**: Leverages Claude's 200K token context window to maintain comprehensive project understanding within each instance while preserving independence between roles.

### **Phase 2: Hybrid AI Strategy (Performance-Contingent)**
- **Contingent Enhancement**: Based on Phase 1 dual-Claude performance metrics, evaluate adding Gemini 2.5 Pro for large context scenarios while maintaining Claude Auditor for SuperClaude features.

- **Context Scalability**: If 200K token limit proves insufficient for enterprise projects, integrate Gemini's 2M token capacity for Developer role while preserving Claude's auditing capabilities.

### **Universal Principles**
- **Automated Task Orchestration**: The collaboration system automatically assigns tasks, manages progress tracking, and coordinates handoffs between AI instances using TaskMaster integration and git commit analysis.

- **Quality-First Architecture**: Multi-stage validation framework with automated code review, security scanning, performance analysis, and architectural compliance checking before any code reaches production.

- **Evidence-Based Management**: All decisions, reviews, and progress tracking are backed by measurable metrics, automated analysis, and systematic documentation.

- **Transparent Governance**: Clear role definitions, authority boundaries, and escalation protocols ensure predictable, reliable AI collaboration with human oversight for critical decisions.

## 2. System Components - AI Collaboration Framework

### **Phase 2 Evaluation Criteria (Performance Gates)**

#### **Context Window Limitation Assessment**
- **Threshold**: >80% of projects hitting 200K token limit
- **User Impact**: Developers reporting context truncation issues
- **Quality Impact**: Code quality degradation due to insufficient context
- **Complexity Ceiling**: Unable to handle enterprise-scale legacy modernization

#### **Performance Benchmarks for Phase 2 Activation**
```yaml
dual_claude_performance_gates:
  context_limits:
    hit_rate: ">80% of enterprise projects"
    user_complaints: ">20% reporting context issues"
    quality_impact: ">15% degradation in complex projects"
  
  success_criteria:
    code_quality: ">8.5/10 average"
    audit_effectiveness: ">90% issue detection"
    user_satisfaction: ">8.0/10 for dual-Claude workflow"
    
  phase2_triggers:
    context_demand: "consistent requests for larger context"
    enterprise_adoption: "50+ enterprise users requesting large context"
    revenue_impact: "$50k+ ARR dependent on large context features"
```

#### **Contingent Implementation Decision Matrix**
- **Go/No-Go Evaluation**: Quarterly assessment after 6 months of Phase 1
- **Success Threshold**: If dual-Claude meets 90% of user needs, delay Phase 2
- **Failure Threshold**: If >50% of enterprise prospects need large context, accelerate Phase 2
- **Hybrid Option**: Implement Phase 2 as premium tier while maintaining dual-Claude as standard

### Targeted Enhancement Workflows **(NEW)**

### Quality Gate Workflows

#### **Automated Code Review Framework**
```yaml
review_criteria:
  code_quality: 30%        # readability, maintainability, standards
  security: 25%           # auth, validation, access control
  performance: 20%        # bundle size, runtime, caching
  architecture: 15%       # patterns, scalability, integration
  testing: 10%           # coverage, quality, regression prevention

review_thresholds:
  auto_approve: 8.5/10    # Automatic approval and merge
  requires_changes: 6.0/10 # Request modifications from Gemini
  escalate_human: 4.0/10  # Critical issues requiring human review
```

#### **Escalation Protocols**
- **Quality Gate Failure**: 3 attempts → Claude review → Human escalation
- **Architectural Decision**: Immediate Claude review → Human approval required
- **Security Concern**: Automatic block → Claude security analysis → Human review
- **Blocked >24h**: Automatic escalation → Human intervention → Resolution tracking

## 5. API Architecture - Enhanced for AI Collaboration

- **Primary Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/orchestrate`
    - This single endpoint handles most user interactions.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "workflow": "sequential_review", // or "parallel_analysis", "task_master_analysis"
      "projectId": "123",
      "prompt": "The user's input text",
      "context": { ... },
      "taskMasterConfig": {
        "complexity_threshold": 0.7,
        "wave_strategy": "systematic",
        "mcp_optimization": true
      }
    }
    ```
- **Response**: The API will use `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` to stream the response back. Each chunk will be a Server-Sent Event (SSE) with a specific type:
    - `event: text_chunk`: A piece of the AI's text response with agent identification (Developer/Auditor/TaskMaster).
    - `event: tool_call`: A request for the user to confirm a tool action via the Command Palette.
    - `event: status_update`: A change in the AI's status (e.g., "generating", "reviewing", "analyzing_tasks", "complete").
    - `event: agent_switch`: Indicates transition between Developer Agent, Auditor Agent, and Task Master.
    - `event: task_analysis`: Task Master analysis results with complexity matrix and dependency data.
    - `event: stream_end`: Signals the end of the response.

## 5. Token Management & Cost Optimization
- **History Summarization**: For long conversations, the integration layer will not send the entire raw history to Gemini. It will use a smaller, cheaper model to summarize the earlier parts of the conversation, sending the summary plus the most recent turns.
- **Context Pruning**: The integration layer will intelligently prune the `context` object in the request, sending only the most relevant parts of a document to the AI, not the entire file.
- **Request Caching**: Identical requests made in a short period can be served from a cache instead of hitting the Gemini API.

## 6. Task Master Coordination

### 6.1. Integration Points
- **Roadmap Analysis**: When a roadmap is approved, it triggers automatic Task Master analysis
- **Real-time Updates**: Task status changes update Task Master metrics and recommendations
- **Multi-Agent Validation**: Task Master analysis is reviewed by Claude Auditor for quality assurance
- **Dynamic Re-planning**: Changes in project scope trigger Task Master re-analysis

### 6.2. Task Master API Integration
```typescript
// Task Master Analysis Trigger
POST /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/tasks/analyze
{
  "roadmapId": "uuid",
  "analysisType": "comprehensive", // or "quick", "update"
  "mcpOptimization": true,
  "waveStrategy": "systematic"
}

// Task Master Results
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/tasks/matrix
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/tasks/critical-path
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/tasks/dependencies
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/tasks/resources
```

### 6.3. Agent Coordination Workflow
1. **User Action**: Approves roadmap or requests task analysis
2. **Orchestrator**: Routes request to Task Master component
3. **Task Master**: Generates comprehensive task breakdown
4. **Claude Auditor**: Reviews analysis for completeness and accuracy
5. **Response Stream**: Real-time updates sent to frontend with task matrix data
6. **UI Update**: Task complexity matrix and dependency graph rendered

## 7. Error Handling
- **AI Failures**: If the Gemini API returns an error or a malformed response, the integration layer will catch it and send a proper `event: error` message to the frontend.
- **Network Issues**: The frontend will have built-in retry logic for dropped connections during streaming.
- **Content Moderation**: All user inputs and AI outputs will be passed through content moderation filters.
- **Task Master Failures**: Fallback to basic task creation with manual complexity scoring if Task Master analysis fails.
