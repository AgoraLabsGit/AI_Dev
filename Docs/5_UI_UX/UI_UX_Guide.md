# Vibe Lab UI/UX Guide

**Document Type**: Technical & Design Standard
**Status**: Authoritative
**Purpose**: This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Vibe Lab user interface and experience, from high-level design philosophy to detailed component implementation and user flows.

## 1. Design Philosophy & User Experience

### 1.1. Core Principles
- **Primary Inspiration**: Strike Bitcoin (ultra-dark aesthetic) and Linear.app (keyboard-driven efficiency).
- **Ultra-Dark First**: A sophisticated dark theme is the foundation.
- **Information Density**: Maximize functionality in minimum space.
- **Keyboard Efficiency**: Every action is accessible via shortcuts.
- **AI-Aware Interface**: Clear status indicators for all AI agents.
- **Pure Tailwind**: Zero custom CSS; all styling is component-local.

### 1.2. The User Journey: Design → Build → Iterate
The user experience is structured around a clear, iterative framework:
1.  **Design**: Users start with an idea, repository, or document. The AI-driven onboarding process (`/onboarding`) helps them craft a high-level **Project Overview**. They then use the Blueprint Editor (`/plan`) to define the detailed **Build Specifications**.
2.  **Build**: The system, guided by the AVCA pipeline and DIAS intelligence, uses the completed blueprint to generate the application code and a detailed roadmap and task list.
3.  **Iterate**: The user can then iterate on the generated code, with the AI providing continuous support for refactoring, adding features, and ensuring quality.

### 1.3. Dynamic Adaptation
The entire system is designed to be a dynamic, intelligent partner. It continuously learns from user interactions, synchronizes all project documents, and uses its AI agents to provide proactive assistance, from suggesting optimizations to identifying potential issues.

## 2. Visual Design System

### 2.1. Color System (Strike-Inspired)
The color system is based on an ultra-dark theme and uses CSS variables for easy management.

*   **Backgrounds**: `--background: #0A0A0B`, `--surface: #111113`
*   **Text**: `--foreground: #FFFFFF`, `--foreground-secondary: #A1A1AA`
*   **Borders**: `--border: #1F1F23`
*   **Functional Colors**: Specific colors are defined for success, warning, error, and agent statuses.

### 2.2. Layout Architecture
- **Primary Structure**: A main header for project context and AI status, with a main content area for stage-specific routes.
- **Responsive Behavior**: The layout adapts from a full three-column view on desktop to a tab-based interface on mobile, using standard Tailwind breakpoints.

### 2.3. Typography
The typography follows the clean, light-weight style of Strike, with a clear hierarchy for headings and distinct styles for body text and technical/code content.

### 2.4. Animation & Transitions
Animations are subtle and performance-focused, used for hover states, focus states, and loading indicators to enhance the user experience without being distracting.

## 3. Navigation & Interaction

### 3.1. Navigation System
The navigation is divided into four main categories:
1.  **Platform Features**: Dashboard, Auth, Teams, Monitoring.
2.  **AVCA Pipeline Stages**: Blueprints, Styling, Pages, Components, Preview.
3.  **Build System**: Generation, Quality, Registry, Assembly.
4.  **AI Intelligence (DIAS)**: Smart Chat, Intent Routing, Learning System.

The primary navigation component is a `MainSidebar`, which has a specialized `CodeDirectory` mode for browsing file structures.

### 3.2. Keyboard-Driven Workflow
Inspired by Linear, the entire interface is optimized for keyboard use.
- **`Cmd+K`**: Opens a global command palette for chat, commands, search, and navigation.
- **Standard Keys**: `Tab`, `Arrow Keys`, `Enter`, and `Esc` provide standard, predictable navigation.

### 3.3. Quick Action System
To accelerate workflows, the AI chat interface generates context-aware buttons (`QuickActions`) that allow users to approve suggestions, make decisions, and execute commands with a single click, reducing the need for typing.

## 4. Page-Specific Flows & Designs

### 4.1. Onboarding (`/onboarding`)
This is the multi-path entry point to the Vibe Lab ecosystem, designed to transform any user input (idea, repo, codebase, docs) into a full application blueprint.
- **Interface**: A split view with a **Visual Builder** on the left and a **Conversational Chat** on the right.
- **Interaction**: The user primarily interacts via `QuickActions` generated by the AI.

### 4.2. Visualize Page (`/project/[projectId]/visualize`)
For the MVP, this page focuses on a GitHub-first workflow.
- **In-App Code Preview**: A read-only interface to inspect the complete generated codebase.
- **GitHub Integration**: A one-click action to create a new GitHub repository and push the code.
- **Post-MVP Vision**: A live, shareable application preview will be added as a future enhancement.

## 5. Application Preview Strategy

The preview system evolves across the AVCA pipeline, always using pure Tailwind CSS to ensure consistency.
- **Stage 0 (Import)**: Previews the analysis of an existing codebase and its conversion to Tailwind.
- **Stage 2 (Styling)**: Live preview of different style template variations.
- **Stage 8 (Assembly)**: A full, shareable preview of the final application (Post-MVP).

The system uses a **Template Variation System**, where different visual styles (e.g., Apple, Linear) are applied by swapping out sets of Tailwind classes, requiring no CSS rebuilds and ensuring zero style conflicts.
