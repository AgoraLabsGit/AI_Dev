# Vibe Lab Testing Strategy

This document outlines the formal testing strategy for the Vibe Lab application. Our strategy is multi-layered to ensure quality, performance, and resilience at all levels of the system.

## 1. Component & Service Testing

This is the foundation of our testing pyramid and focuses on isolated components and services.

*   **Unit Tests**: Each individual service and major function must have a corresponding suite of unit tests. These tests validate the core logic in isolation, using mocks for external dependencies.
*   **Integration Tests**: We create integration tests to validate the interactions *between* services. For example, we will test the full flow from the `AIClientService` to the `ContextManager` to ensure they work together as expected.

## 2. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests validate the entire system from the user's perspective.

*   **AVCA Pipeline Validation**: We have a suite of E2E tests that simulate a full run of the AVCA pipeline, from receiving a user prompt to generating the final code. This validates that the entire system is functioning correctly.

## 3. Performance & Resilience Testing

Given the nature of our AI-driven system, performance and resilience are critical.

*   **Performance Validation**:
    *   **Token Tracking**: Token usage is tracked on every AI call from day one.
    *   **Cost Monitoring**: We use a dedicated dashboard to monitor the cost of all AI operations against our established budget.
    *   **Quality Gates**: Automated quality gates are used to ensure that all generated code meets our minimum quality standards.
*   **Resilience Testing**:
    *   **Error Injection**: We intentionally inject errors into the system to validate that our retry logic and circuit breakers are functioning correctly.
    *   **Rate Limit Verification**: We have tests that specifically verify our rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent API abuse.
    *   **Circuit Breaker Validation**: We test to ensure our circuit breakers open and close correctly, preventing cascading failures across the system.
