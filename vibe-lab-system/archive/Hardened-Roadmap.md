# Task Reorganization: Original â†’ Integrated Roadmap

## How Original Tasks Map to New Phases

### Phase 0: Minimal Vertical Slice (Week 1)
**New Phase - No Original Tasks**
```yaml
New Tasks:

  - Cost/quality/time validation
  - Go/No-Go decision documentation
```

### Phase 1: Event-Driven Architecture (Week 2)
**Uses Tasks From:**
- Original Phase 2.1 (AI Client Implementation)
- Original Phase 2.2 (Context Manager)
- Original Phase 1.3 (Base Configuration)

```yaml
Original Tasks to Use:
  âœ… Create lib/config/ai.config.ts (Original 1.3)
  âœ… Implement VibeLab AIClient.ts (Original 2.1)
  âœ… Create ContextManager.ts (Original 2.2)
  
New Event Architecture:
  ðŸ†• Set up Redis/NATS event bus
  ðŸ†• Create service skeletons
  ðŸ†• Refactor chat â†’ event publisher
```

### Phase 2: Quality Gates & Safety Nets (Week 3)
**Uses Tasks From:**
- Original Phase 1.1 (Database Schema Extension)
- Original Phase 1.2 (Project Structure Setup)
- Original Phase 3.4 (Quality Gates)

```yaml
Original Tasks to Use:
  âœ… Extend Prisma schema with AVCA tables (Original 1.1)
  âœ… Create lib/ directory structure (Original 1.2)
  âœ… Implement quality gate system (Original 3.4)
  
Enhanced with Safety:
  ðŸ†• Static analysis pipeline
  ðŸ†• Auto-fix loops
  ðŸ†• Typed contracts with Zod
```

### Phase 3: Service Implementation (Week 4)
**Uses Tasks From:**
- Original Phase 3.1 (Component Registry)
- Original Phase 3.2-3.3 (Pipeline Stages)
- Original Phase 2.3 (Chat Integration Enhancement)

```yaml
Original Tasks to Use:
  âœ… Implement ComponentRegistry.ts (Original 3.1)
  âœ… Implement pipeline stages 1-8 (Original 3.2-3.3)
  âœ… Enhance dual-Claude chat (Original 2.3)
  
Reorganized as Services:
  ðŸ”„ Blueprint Service (stages 1-3)
  ðŸ”„ Generation Service (stages 4-5)
  ðŸ”„ Audit Service (stage 6)
  ðŸ”„ Assembly Service (stages 7-8)
```

### Phase 4: Cost & Performance Controls (Week 5)
**New Phase - Uses Concepts From:**
- Original performance considerations
- Token optimization strategies

```yaml
New Tasks Based on Hardening Plan:
  ðŸ†• Token budget manager
  ðŸ†• Context summarization service
  ðŸ†• Cost monitoring dashboard
  ðŸ†• Emergency mode controls
```

### Phase 5: Testing Infrastructure (Week 6)
**Uses Tasks From:**
- Original Phase 6.1 (Component Testing)
- Original Phase 6.2 (Integration Testing)
- Original Phase 6.3 (Performance Optimization)

```yaml
Original Tasks to Use:
  âœ… Write component tests (Original 6.1)
  âœ… Test pipeline workflows (Original 6.2)
  âœ… Performance optimization (Original 6.3)
  
Enhanced with Infrastructure:
  ðŸ†• Parallel test generation
  ðŸ†• Container test farm
  ðŸ†• Golden test repository
```

### Phase 6: Integration & Migration (Week 7)
**Uses Tasks From:**
- Original Phase 5.1 (Design Hub Implementation)
- Original Phase 5.2 (AVCA-DIAS Integration)
- Original Phase 5.3 (Approval Flow Widget)

```yaml
Original Tasks to Use:
  âœ… Create Design Hub pages (Original 5.1)
  âœ… Implement integration layer (Original 5.2)
  âœ… Create ApprovalWidget component (Original 5.3)
  
Migration Focus:
  ðŸ”„ Connect services with UI
  ðŸ”„ Migrate from direct calls to events
```

### Phase 7: DIAS Gradual Rollout (Week 8)
**Uses Tasks From:**
- Original Phase 4.1-4.3 (DIAS Implementation)
- But with gradual approach

```yaml
Original Tasks to Use (Modified):
  âœ… Core DIAS Modules (Original 4.1) â†’ Observation mode only
  âœ… Adaptation Workflows (Original 4.2) â†’ Offline experiments
  âœ… Memory System (Original 4.3) â†’ Pattern collection
  
Gradual Approach:
  ðŸ”„ Start with metrics collection
  ðŸ”„ Offline suggestions via PRs
  ðŸ”„ No auto-application initially
```

## What This Means Practically

### 1. Keep Original Task Details
```typescript
// Example: Original Phase 2.1 AI Client Implementation
// Still use the exact code examples and specifications
const vibeLabAIStack = {
  developer: {
    model: "claude-3-opus-20240229",
    // ... exact settings from original plan
  }
};

// But implement it within Phase 1: Event Architecture
```

### 2. Reorganize the Sequence
```yaml
Original Sequence: Database â†’ AI â†’ AVCA â†’ DIAS â†’ UI â†’ Testing
New Sequence:     Validation â†’ Events â†’ Safety â†’ Services â†’ Testing â†’ UI â†’ DIAS
```

### 3. Enhanced with Safety
```typescript
// Original task: "Implement ComponentRegistry.ts"
// Enhanced: "Implement ComponentRegistry.ts with event publishing"

class ComponentRegistry {
  async register(component: Component) {
    // Original functionality
    const registered = await this.database.save(component);
    
    // Enhanced with events
    await eventBus.publish({
      type: 'component.registered',
      component: registered
    });
    
    return registered;
  }
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Use Original Tasks When:
- âœ… They fit the new phase structure
- âœ… Implementation details are solid
- âœ… Documentation references are complete

### Enhance Tasks When:
- ðŸ”„ They need event-driven architecture
- ðŸ”„ They need better error handling
- ðŸ”„ They need cost controls

### Create New Tasks When:
- ðŸ†• Validation is needed (Phase 0)
- ðŸ†• Safety nets are required
- ðŸ†• Performance controls are missing

---

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Start Phase 0** (new tasks)
2. **Reorganize original detailed tasks** under new phase structure
3. **Keep all original documentation** as implementation reference
4. **Enhance tasks** with event architecture and safety nets
5. **Maintain same level of detail** but in new sequence

The original roadmap becomes our **implementation library** - we just reorganize when and how we use those tasks based on the hardening plan's safer approach.
