# Future Enhancements & Feature Ideas

This document is a log of potential future enhancements and feature ideas for Vibe Lab. It serves as a parking lot for brainstorming and will be reviewed periodically to inform the official development roadmap.

*(This list was originally sourced from `vibe-lab-docs(old)/development/Notes`)*

## System Intelligence & Automation

*   **Automated Directory Auditing**: An AI agent could periodically review the repository for structural integrity, code cohesion, and overall system health, including checking that core systems like the Task Master are functioning correctly.
*   **Automated Agent Collaboration**: Further automate the collaboration between the different AI agents (e.g., Gemini and Claude), such as having audit results automatically pushed between them for review and task list updates, followed by human approval.
*   **Automated System Optimization**: Continuously explore opportunities to automate and optimize Vibe Lab's internal functions and workflows.
*   **Python Script Integration**: Leverage Python scripts for more advanced system intelligence and automation tasks.

## User-Facing Features

*   **Project Dashboard v2**: An enhanced project dashboard that displays detailed metrics, such as:
    *   Number of tasks completed.
    *   Lines of code written by AI vs. human.
    *   Overall project completion percentage.
    *   Number of major pivots or changes.
*   **"Quick Add" System**: A universal capture system where a user can add a quick note or idea (like the ones on this list), which the AI would then automatically process and integrate into the appropriate place in the Vibe Lab system (e.g., creating a new task, updating the roadmap, adding to this document).
*   **Enhanced Error Logging**: Integrate a more robust error logging system that captures front-end, back-end, and server errors, and feeds them back into the development loop and the Learning Log.
*   **Enhanced Quick Commands**: Expand the Quick Action system with more advanced and context-aware commands.
