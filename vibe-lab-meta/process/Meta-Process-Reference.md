x# Meta-Process Reference - Building Vibe Lab with Vibe Lab

## The Meta Challenge

We are building Vibe Lab using the AVCA-DIAS system that Vibe Lab itself implements. This creates a recursive development process where the tool builds itself.

## Directory Architecture

### Separation of Concerns

```

## The Bootstrap Process

### Phase 1: Manual Foundation (What we're doing now)
```typescript
// We manually create the core AVCA-DIAS system
const manualWork = {
  documentation: "6 reference documents",
  coreArchitecture: "AVCA + DIAS design",
  initialImplementation: "30% complete"
}
```

### Phase 2: System Becomes Self-Aware
```typescript
// The system starts managing its own development
const selfAware = {
  blueprints: "Vibe Lab creates its own blueprints",
  pipeline: "AVCA pipeline generates Vibe Lab components",
  dias: "DIAS manages Vibe Lab's evolution"
}
```

### Phase 3: Full Self-Development
```typescript
// Vibe Lab fully develops itself
const selfDevelopment = {
  newFeatures: "Added through AVCA pipeline",
  improvements: "DIAS suggests and implements",
  evolution: "System improves itself"
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Clean System Directory

```bash
# Create clean AVCA-DIAS system
mkdir -p vibe-lab-system/{avca-core,dias-core,docs,templates}

# Copy pure system implementations
cp -r lib/avca/* vibe-lab-system/avca-core/
cp -r lib/dias/* vibe-lab-system/dias-core/

# This becomes the "engine" that others can use
```

### 2. Product Directory with .vibe Workspace

```bash
# The actual Vibe Lab product
cd vibe-lab-product

# Initialize AVCA-DIAS workspace
mkdir -p .vibe/{blueprints,components,pipeline-state}

# Create Vibe Lab's own blueprints
cat > .vibe/blueprints/01-vibe-lab-vision.md << EOF
# Vibe Lab Product Blueprint
This is Vibe Lab describing itself to itself...
EOF
```

### 3. Meta Documentation

```typescript
// vibe-lab-meta/development-log.md
interface MetaDevelopmentLog {
  entry: {
    date: Date;
    phase: "manual" | "assisted" | "autonomous";
    whatBuilt: string;
    howBuilt: "manually" | "avca-pipeline" | "dias-suggestion";
    insights: string[];
  }[];
}
```

## Practical Workflows

### When Building System Features

```typescript
// Working in: vibe-lab-system/
// Example: Adding new atomic unit type

// 1. Update system documentation
updateFile("vibe-lab-system/docs/AVCA-Reference.md");

// 2. Implement in core
createFile("vibe-lab-system/avca-core/units/NewUnit.ts");

// 3. System feature is now available for ALL projects
```

### When Building Product Features

```typescript
// Working in: vibe-lab-product/
// Example: Adding dashboard enhancement

// 1. Use AVCA pipeline (eating our own dog food)
runCommand("vibe-lab blueprint 'Enhanced dashboard with analytics'");

// 2. System generates components
// Output: .vibe/components/generated/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx

// 3. Copy to product
copyFile(".vibe/components/generated/*", "components/");
```

### When Documenting Meta-Process

```typescript
// Working in: vibe-lab-meta/
// Track HOW we built what we built

logDecision({
  what: "Used AVCA to generate own dashboard",
  why: "Prove system works for complex components",
  outcome: "Success - 80% generated, 20% manual polish",
  learnings: ["Need better state management patterns"]
});
```

## Avoiding Confusion

### Clear Indicators

1. **File Headers**
```typescript
/**
 * @system AVCA-DIAS Core System
 * @layer Engine
 * @not Product-specific code
 */
```

2. **Directory Markers**
```bash
# vibe-lab-system/README.md
This directory contains the PURE AVCA-DIAS system.
It should work for ANY project, not just Vibe Lab.

# vibe-lab-product/README.md  
This is the Vibe Lab SaaS product, built using AVCA-DIAS.
Product-specific features go here.
```

3. **Import Paths**
```typescript
// Clear separation in imports
import { Pipeline } from '@vibe-lab/system/avca-core';  // System
import { Dashboard } from '@/components';               // Product
```

## Meta-Benefits

### What This Separation Enables

1. **Open Source Potential**
   - Can release `vibe-lab-system` as standalone framework
   - Other projects can use AVCA-DIAS

2. **Clear Testing**
   - System tests: "Does AVCA work for ANY project?"
   - Product tests: "Does Vibe Lab work for users?"

3. **Better Documentation**
   - System docs: "How to use AVCA-DIAS"
   - Product docs: "How to use Vibe Lab"
   - Meta docs: "How we built both"

4. **Recursive Improvement**
   - Vibe Lab can improve its own AVCA-DIAS system
   - Updates benefit both system and product

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions

- [ ] Create three directory structure
- [ ] Move pure system code to `vibe-lab-system/`
- [ ] Initialize `.vibe/` workspace in product
- [ ] Create first meta-process log entry
- [ ] Add clear README files to each directory

### When Building

Ask yourself:
1. "Is this a system feature or product feature?"
2. "Should this work for ANY project or just Vibe Lab?"
3. "Am I building the hammer or using the hammer?"

### Documentation Rule

Every significant decision should be logged in THREE places:
1. System docs (if it's an AVCA-DIAS enhancement)
2. Product docs (if it's a Vibe Lab feature)
3. Meta docs (HOW we made the decision)

## The Meta-Vision

Eventually, Vibe Lab should be able to:
1. Generate its own enhancement proposals
2. Implement them through AVCA pipeline
3. Test them with DIAS intelligence
4. Deploy improvements to itself
5. Document what it learned

This is the ultimate validation: **A system sophisticated enough to improve itself**.

## Tracking Meta-Progress

```typescript
interface MetaMetrics {
  manualCode: "Lines written by humans";
  generatedCode: "Lines generated by AVCA";
  diasSuggestions: "Improvements from DIAS";
  selfImprovement: "Features Vibe Lab added to itself";
  
  // The goal
  autonomyRatio: "Generated / (Generated + Manual)";
  targetAutonomy: 0.8; // 80% self-built
}
```
