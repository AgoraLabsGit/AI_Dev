# Tasks: Native AI Integration
**Derived From**: Roadmap-2-Native-AI-Integration.md
**Purpose**: Detailed task breakdown for integrating the native Vibe Lab AI intelligence layer by wrapping the external `task-master` CLI.

## Phase 2: DIAS Core Integration with SuperClaude & TaskMaster
**Objective**: To integrate the foundational DIAS services by creating TypeScript service wrappers that programmatically interact with the external `task-master` CLI and its underlying SuperClaude toolset.

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Dependencies | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | **Integrate DIAS Core Architecture** | | | |
| 2.1.1 | Create AI Orchestrator Service | Create a TypeScript wrapper for the `task-master` CLI. Must implement resilience patterns (Token Bucket, Circuit Breaker) before calling the external CLI. | None | 8/10 |
| 2.1.2 | Create MCP Server Interfaces | Create TypeScript interfaces to invoke the `Context7`, `Sequential`, `Magic`, and `Playwright` servers via the `task-master` CLI. | 2.1.1 | 7/10 |
| 2.1.3 | Create Context Manager Service | Create a service to prepare data for the CLI and implement LRU caching to minimize redundant calls. **Must** use a new summarization approach, not the failed compression algorithm. | 2.1.1 | 8/10 |
| **2.2** | **Integrate DIAS Intelligence Modules** | | | |
| 2.2.1 | Create Conversational Interface | Create a service that uses the AI Orchestrator Service (2.1.1) to perform intent classification. | 2.1.1, 2.1.3 | 9/10 |
| 2.2.2 | Create Task Master Service | Create the primary TypeScript service wrapper for the `task-master` CLI's core task-management functions. | None | 7/10 |
| 2.2.3 | Integrate Other Modules | Create wrappers for `Feature Integration`, `System Synchronizer`, etc., using the `task-master` CLI. | 2.1.1 | 8/10 |
| **2.3** | **Integrate DIAS System Memory & Adaptation** | | | |
| 2.3.1 | Integrate Multi-Layered Memory | Create services that prepare and pass data to the `task-master` CLI for its memory functions. | 2.1.3 | 7/10 |
| 2.3.2 | Integrate Adaptation Workflows | Create a service to manage the SuperClaude Wave System by invoking the appropriate `task-master` commands. | 2.1.1 | 8/10 |

## Phase 3: AVCA & DIAS Integration
**Objective**: To refactor the existing, functional AVCA components to communicate with and be controlled by the new DIAS service wrappers.

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Dependencies | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.1.1 | Refactor AVCA Core Pipeline | Modify pipeline stages to call the new DIAS service wrappers. | Phase 2 | 7/10 |
| 3.1.2 | Integrate Quality Intelligence | Replace manual checks with calls to the DIAS Quality service wrapper. | 3.1.1 | 6/10 |
| 3.2.1 | Integrate Staged Initialization | Add the new DIAS service wrappers to the `ServiceManager`. | Phase 2 | 5/10 |
| 3.3.1 | Unify Data & Event Flow | Create a unified `PipelineData` object for use with the service wrappers. | 3.1.1 | 6/10 |
| 3.4.1 | Implement Intelligent Caching | Build a caching strategy for AVCA, managed by the DIAS service wrappers. | 2.3.1 | 7/10 |

---

## Phase 4: Process Automation
**Objective**: To build automated systems that leverage the `task-master` CLI.

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Dependencies | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4.1.1 | Git Commit Parser | Extract task info from Git commit messages. | None | 5/10 |
| 4.1.2 | Task Status Updater | Auto-update task status by calling the Task Master Service (2.2.2). | 2.2.2, 4.1.1 | 6/10 |
