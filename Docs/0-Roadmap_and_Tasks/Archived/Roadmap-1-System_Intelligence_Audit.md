### 1.2. Staged Initialization

*   **[x] `ServiceManager`**:
    *   [x] Manages service lifecycles.

*   **[ ] Resilience & Performance**:
    *   [x] Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms.

    *   [x] Parallel processing of tasks.

### 1.4. Component Architecture

*   **[x] Component Registry**:
    *   [x] Database for storing component versions (implemented as in-memory cache in `ComponentCatalogService`).
    *   [x] Enables versioning and dependency tracking.

## 2. DIAS (Dynamic Intelligence & Adaptation System)

### 2.1. Core Architecture

*   **[x] DIAS Event System**:
    *   [x] Pub/sub architecture.

    *   [ ] `Sequential` (Deep Analysis)
    *   [ ] `Magic` (UI Generation)
    *   [ ] `Playwright` (E2E Testing)
*   **[x] Context Manager**:
    *   [x] Prepares and optimizes context for AI agents.
    *   [ ] Uses LRU cache.
    *   [ ] Uses content compression.
    *   [ ] Uses a priority-based sliding window.

### 2.2. Core Intelligence Modules

*   **[ ] Conversational Interface**:
    *   [ ] Classifies user intent from chat.
    *   [ ] Routes to the appropriate service.
    *   [ ] Integrates with Context Keeper and Memory System.
*   **[ ] Task Master System**:
    *   [ ] Task Complexity Analysis.
    *   [ ] Dependency Management & Critical Path Analysis.
    *   [ ] Resource & Wave Planning.
*   **[x] Other Key Modules**:
    *   [ ] Feature Integration Engine.
    *   [ ] System Synchronizer.
    *   [ ] Predictive Analytics.
    *   [x] Learning System.
    *   [ ] Quality Intelligence.
    *   [ ] Error Intelligence.

### 2.3. System Memory & Adaptation

*   **[ ] Multi-Layered Memory**:
    *   [ ] Short-Term (In-Memory).
    *   [ ] Medium-Term (Redis).
    *   [ ] Long-Term (Database).
*   **[ ] Adaptation Workflows**:
    *   [ ] Sequential Enhancement (Default).
