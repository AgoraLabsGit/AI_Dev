- Update token tracking for multi-model

### CO.3 | Run optimization validation | High | Critical | Pending | CO.2 | 4h
- Execute abbreviated test
- Verify cost < $0.50
- Confirm quality > 90%

### CO.4 | Deploy monitoring updates | Medium | Major | Pending | CO.3 | 4h
- Update cost dashboard for multi-model
- Add model selection visualization
- Set up production alerts

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (5 days)

## Phase 2: Core Systems Build (30h)

// ... existing code ...

## Success Metrics

### Phase 0 Results
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Time | <30min | 16.5s | ✅ PASS |
| Cost | <$0.50 | $2.84 | ❌ FAIL |
| Quality | >90% | 93% | ✅ PASS |
| Manual | <20% | 13% | ✅ PASS |

### Optimization Targets
- Cost: $2.84 → $0.48 (83% reduction)
- Model: Opus → Sonnet/Haiku mix
- Quality: Maintain >90%

## Risk Assessment

### Mitigated Risks ✅
- Pipeline complexity (proven viable)
- Integration challenges (successful E2E)
- Quality degradation (gates effective)

### Active Risks ⚠️
- Cost optimization effectiveness
- Model performance variance
- Context window management

## Next Actions
1. **Immediate**: Begin CO.1 - Model selection implementation
2. **Day 2**: Complete CO.2-CO.3 validation
3. **Day 4**: Deploy monitoring and proceed to Phase 1
4. **Week 2**: Start AVCA-001 microservices
