# Vibe Lab - Staged Development Roadmaps

**Document Type**: Development Strategy & Implementation Phases  
**Status**: Active Planning Document  
**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**Purpose**: Intelligent, staged roadmaps for systematic Vibe Lab development, optimized for TaskMaster integration

---

## Executive Summary

The Vibe Lab system is architecturally sophisticated but suffers from critical disconnections between its components. Rather than rebuild, these roadmaps focus on **systematic integration and cleanup** to unlock the platform's existing capabilities.

**Core Strategy**: Fix foundational issues first, then progressively enhance and extend functionality.

## Implementation Guidelines

### For TaskMaster Integration

Each roadmap phase is designed to be broken down into specific, actionable tasks that TaskMaster can process:

1. **Task Structure**
   - Each key task can become a TaskMaster epic
   - Sub-tasks should be atomic and testable
   - Include clear acceptance criteria
   - Add time estimates for each task

2. **Dependencies**
   - Roadmaps are sequential (complete 1 before 2)
   - Phases within roadmaps can have some parallelization
   - Document inter-task dependencies clearly
   - Identify blocking vs non-blocking tasks

3. **Validation Points**
   - Each phase ends with testing/validation
   - Include specific success metrics
   - Add rollback procedures if needed
   - Document learned lessons

### Priority Guidelines

1. **Must Have** (Roadmap 1): Foundation fixes are non-negotiable
2. **Should Have** (Roadmap 2-3): Feature activation and UX improvements
3. **Nice to Have** (Roadmap 4-5): Production features and advanced capabilities

### Resource Allocation

- **Roadmap 1**: 1-2 senior developers
- **Roadmap 2**: 2-3 developers + 1 AI specialist
- **Roadmap 3**: 2 frontend developers + 1 UX designer
