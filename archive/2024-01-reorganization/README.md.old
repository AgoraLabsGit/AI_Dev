# Vibe Lab Meta-Process

This directory documents how we built Vibe Lab using its own AVCA-DIAS system - the meta-process of Vibe Lab building itself.

## Directory Structure

### `/process`
Documentation of the meta-process:
- How we built Vibe Lab using AVCA-DIAS
- Key architectural decisions
- System extraction process
- Meta-development workflow

### `/learning`
Lessons and improvements:
- What we learned building Vibe Lab
- System improvements discovered
- Meta-process refinements
- AI optimization insights

### `/blueprints`
Vibe Lab's own blueprints:
- AVCA blueprints for Vibe Lab features
- Self-generated components
- Meta-process artifacts
- System evolution plans

## Usage

This documentation will be populated during Phase 4.5 when we:
1. Extract the clean AVCA-DIAS system
2. Start using it to build Vibe Lab
3. Document the meta-process
4. Track system improvements

For now, this directory structure serves as a placeholder for the meta-process documentation that will emerge during development.
