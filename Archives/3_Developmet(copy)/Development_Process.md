# Vibe Lab Development Process

**Document Type**: Process & Standards
**Status**: Authoritative
**Purpose**: This document is the single source of truth for the Vibe Lab development process. It outlines our core principles, the Single Source of Truth architecture, AVCA pipeline, and standardized workflows that all team members and AI agents must follow.

---

## 1. The Vibe Lab Vision: Single Source of Truth Development

Vibe Lab revolutionizes software development by creating **structured frameworks that make development clean, efficient, adaptable, and iterative** through a Single Source of Truth architecture.

### The Problem with Traditional Development:
- Requirements live in documents that become outdated
- Code drifts from original specifications over time
- No central authority driving all development decisions
- Changes require manual coordination across multiple files and systems
- Documentation and code become disconnected

### Vibe Lab's Solution: Single Source of Truth Architecture
Every aspect of development flows from and stays synchronized with two foundational documents:

**Project Overview** → Drives all feature decisions, user flows, component purposes, and business logic
**Build Specifications** → Drives tech stack choices, architecture patterns, integrations, and data models

These aren't static documents - they're **living configuration files** that:
- Every component, API, database schema, and generated code references
- Automatically cascade changes through the entire codebase
- Enable iterative updates that maintain system-wide consistency
- Serve as the authoritative source for all development decisions

## 2. Core Philosophy & Principles

Our methodology is built on a set of core principles that enable the Single Source of Truth architecture:

*   **Single Source of Truth First**: All development flows from and references the Project Overview and Build Specifications. These documents are the system's brain that coordinates all development.
*   **Build Product-First, Extract System Later**: We validate features in `vibe-lab-product` against real-world use cases before extracting proven, generic components into the `vibe-lab-system`.
*   **Document-Driven Development**: Every component, API, and feature is generated from and stays synchronized with the foundational documents.
*   **Iterative by Design**: Changes to the Single Source of Truth automatically propagate through the system, enabling safe iteration.
*   **Systematic Execution**: We follow a "Task-First" approach: fully understand requirements, plan the implementation, execute the plan, and validate the result.
*   **Event-Driven & Modular Architecture**: Our system is built on an event-driven model with modular components that all reference the same foundational documents.
*   **Conservative Defaults & Evidence-Based Decisions**: We start with safe, conservative configurations and make all decisions based on verifiable data from documentation, tests, or metrics.

## 3. The AVCA Pipeline: AI-Verified Component Architecture

The AI-Verified Component Architecture (AVCA) pipeline transforms the Single Source of Truth documents into working applications through a systematic, staged approach powered by SuperClaude intelligence.

### AVCA Core Philosophy: "Everything is a Component"
AVCA treats every part of an application as a component - from UI buttons to infrastructure patterns - enabling consistent quality, versioning, and reuse across the entire system.

### AVCA Pipeline Stages:

**Stage 0 - Document Creation (Onboarding Blueprint):**
- User conversation → Project Overview + Build Specifications  
- Creates the Single Source of Truth documents that drive everything else
- Powered by SuperClaude architect persona for deeper requirement analysis

**Stage 1 - Blueprint Parser:**
- Documents → Structured Blueprint with component architecture
- Parses raw blueprint data, analyzes requirements, identifies dependencies
- Uses SuperClaude frontend/backend personas for intelligent planning

**Stage 2 - Component Planner:**
- Blueprint → Detailed implementation plan with architectural patterns
- Advanced Component Configuration wizard for data bindings and business logic
- Creates TypeScript interfaces and comprehensive test plans

**Stage 3 - Code Generator (Magic Component Pipeline):**
- Plan → Working code files (.tsx, .test.tsx, .stories.tsx)
- Powered by SuperClaude Magic MCP server for UI component generation
- Generates component variations at scale with design system integration

**Stage 4 - Quality Assurance (8-Step Validation):**
- Code → Production-ready components with full validation
- Enhanced with SuperClaude's 8-step quality gates and AI-powered suggestions
- TypeScript validation, performance optimization, accessibility compliance

**Stage 5 - Component Registry:**
- Validated components → Versioned registry with dependency tracking
- Every component version stored with metadata and reuse capabilities
- Enables systematic component evolution and conflict resolution

**Stage 6 - Integration Layer:**
- Registry → APIs, database schemas, authentication systems
- Creates backend systems based on Build Specifications requirements
- Handles service orchestration and data flow integration

**Stage 7 - System Assembly:**
- Integrated components → Complete application with navigation and routing
- Assembles all components into working application structure
- Handles deployment configuration and environment setup

**Stage 8 - Production Deployment:**

## 6. Document-Driven Development Cycle

All development work **must** follow this Single Source of Truth development cycle:

### For New Features:
1.  **Update Source Documents**: Modify Project Overview and/or Build Specifications to reflect new requirements
2.  **Validate Document Changes**: Ensure changes maintain consistency and don't create conflicts
3.  **Generate Architecture**: Use AVCA pipeline to generate component architecture from updated documents
4.  **Implement Components**: Generate actual code that references the foundational documents
5.  **Test Integration**: Validate that new code integrates properly with existing system
6.  **Update Documentation**: Log changes and learnings in development logs

### For Iterative Changes:
1.  **Identify Source Impact**: Determine if change requires updating Project Overview, Build Specifications, or both
2.  **Update Documents**: Make changes to the Single Source of Truth documents
3.  **Cascade Changes**: Allow AVCA pipeline to propagate changes through dependent components
4.  **Validate Consistency**: Ensure all generated code remains synchronized with documents
5.  **Test System**: Verify that changes work correctly across the entire application

### Document Reference Requirements:
- Every component must include header comments referencing relevant Project Overview sections
- API routes must reference Build Specifications for tech stack and integration decisions
- Database schemas must trace back to data requirements in both documents
- All generated code must be regenerable from the foundational documents

---

## 7. Single Source of Truth Implementation Strategy

### 7.1. Document Creation & Management
**Project Overview Creation:**
- Generated through AI-powered onboarding conversation
- Contains: project name, description, target users, key features, problem solved, success metrics
- Drives all feature decisions and component purposes

**Build Specifications Creation:**  
- Generated from Project Overview + technical requirements
- Contains: architecture, tech stack, data models, integrations, performance requirements, security needs
- Drives all technical implementation decisions

**Document Versioning:**
- All changes tracked with version history and change reasoning
- Impact analysis shows downstream effects of changes
- Rollback capability for any document version

### 7.2. AVCA Pipeline Integration
**Stage 0 Implementation (Current):**
- Onboarding system creates initial Single Source of Truth documents
- Stage-specific prompts guide document completion
- Iteration support allows document updates throughout development

**Remaining Stages (To Be Implemented):**
- Each stage reads from and validates against the foundational documents
- Generated components include traceability back to source documents
- Changes cascade automatically through dependent stages
- All code remains regenerable from the documents

### 7.3. Validation-First Integration
Before using the AVCA system to generate new code:
*   **Goal**: Ensure the Single Source of Truth documents accurately reflect current implementation
*   **Process**: Validate existing codebase against newly created documents using DIAS analysis
*   **Success Criteria**: Compliance score >90% with only minor gaps identified

### 7.4. Sandbox-First Development
All AVCA-generated code development uses sandbox environments:
*   **Goal**: Safely test document-driven generation without affecting main codebase
*   **Process**:
    1.  Create sandboxed directory within project
    2.  Use AVCA pipeline to generate features from Single Source of Truth documents
    3.  Thoroughly test and validate generated code in sandbox
    4.  Manually integrate validated features into main codebase
*   **Benefits**: Risk-free experimentation while validating the Single Source of Truth approach

## 8. Engineering Standards & Quality Gates

These are the non-negotiable quality standards for the Vibe Lab platform. They are enforced automatically by our CI/CD pipeline and the Auditor AI.

### **Performance SLAs**
*   **API Response Time (p95)**: < 200ms
*   **AI First Token Time (p95)**: < 1.5 seconds
*   **Platform Uptime**: 99.9%

### **Quality Gates (Enforced by CI/CD)**
*   **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80%
*   **Security Score**: Minimum 9/10 (per Auditor AI)
*   **Accessibility**: Must meet WCAG AA standards.
*   **Typing**: Must pass TypeScript strict mode. The `any` type is strictly forbidden.

### **Security Requirements**
*   **OWASP Guidelines**: Adhere to the OWASP Top 10 security best practices.
*   **Validate All Inputs**: Especially data coming from AI model responses.
*   **Use Environment Variables**: No secrets may be hardcoded.

---

## 9. Architectural Patterns & Code Standards

To ensure a consistent, stable, and maintainable codebase, all code **must** adhere to the following patterns and standards.

### **Single Source of Truth Requirements**
*   **Document Reference Headers**: All generated files must include header comments linking to the specific Project Overview or Build Specifications sections that drove their creation.
*   **Traceability**: Every component, API route, and database schema must be traceable back to requirements in the foundational documents.
*   **Regeneration Capability**: All code must be regenerable from the Single Source of Truth documents without manual intervention.
*   **Document Synchronization**: When foundational documents change, all dependent code must be updated through the AVCA pipeline.

### **Required Architectural Patterns**
*   **Staged Initialization for APIs**: Use the three-stage loading pattern to prevent API route hanging.
*   **Health-Aware Routing**: The router must intelligently send requests to the best available service.
*   **Consistent Service Base Class**: All backend services must extend the `BaseService` class.
*   **Document-Aware Components**: All components must declare their relationship to Project Overview features and Build Specifications architecture.

### **Required Code Standards (Enforced by CI/CD)**
*   **PWA Compliance**:
    *   **44px Minimum Touch Targets**: All interactive elements must be accessible.
    *   **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<button>`).
    *   **Mobile-First & Responsive Design**: Design for mobile first and ensure proper reflow.
*   **Component Architecture**:
    *   **TypeScript Interfaces**: All components must define proper prop interfaces.
    *   **Composition over Monoliths**: Components should not exceed 200 lines.
    *   **Systematic Spacing & Theming**: Use design tokens from the theme for all colors and spacing.
*   **Layout & Styling**:
    *   **Pure Tailwind CSS**: No custom CSS files, CSS-in-JS, or external design systems.
    *   **CSS Grid for Structure**: Use CSS Grid for complex page layouts.
*   **Branching & Commits**:
    *   **GitHub Flow**: `main` is the source of truth; all work is done in `feature branches`.
    *   **Conventional Commits**: All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
    *   **Prettier Formatting**: All code is automatically formatted by Prettier.

### **Prohibited Practices (Blocked by CI)**
*   **Document Violations**: Creating components or APIs without tracing back to foundational documents.
*   **Manual Code Generation**: Writing code that should be generated from the Single Source of Truth documents.
*   **Document Bypass**: Making changes to generated code without updating the source documents first.
*   Touch targets smaller than 44px.
*   Complex nested flexbox where CSS Grid is appropriate.
*   Using `hidden sm:block` for responsive design instead of proper reflow.
*   Hardcoding colors or spacing values.
*   Use of the TypeScript `any` type.
