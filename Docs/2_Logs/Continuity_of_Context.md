#### **Current Goal**
Completed Meta Systems implementation: Product Code Extraction & AI Intelligence Monitoring with enhanced UI.

#### **Current Status**

*   **âœ… Meta Systems Implementation Complete**: Two critical development systems now operational
*   **âœ… Product Code Extraction System**: Clean Vibe Lab product separation from development infrastructure
*   **âœ… AI Intelligence Monitoring System**: Real-time visibility into AVCA/DIAS module activations with enhanced UI
*   **âœ… Code Marking Framework**: Comment-based system (@vibe-lab/core, @vibe-lab/build) for automated code separation
*   **âœ… Monitoring Dashboard Enhancement**: Complete ultra-dark theme implementation matching Strike Bitcoin aesthetic
*   **âœ… Page Context Tracking**: Enhanced monitoring with source page, route, and 25+ metadata fields
*   **âœ… Previous Phase 1A Implementation**: All SuperClaude integration services successfully implemented and activated
*   **âœ… Documentation Consolidation**: Major documentation restructuring and feature preservation completed
*   **âœ… Single Source of Truth System**: Document versioning and iteration system implemented
*   **âœ… Service Infrastructure**:
    *   **PersonaMapper**: 100% operational with all 11 personas and mapping capabilities
    *   **Context7 MCP Service**: Structurally complete and ready for CLI integration
    *   **Enhanced AI Client**: Fully operational with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (fixed environment loading)
    *   **API Endpoints**: /plan tested and working, /review and /help comprehensive testing complete
    *   **EventBus & ServiceRegistry**: Core infrastructure operational and monitoring all services
*   **âœ… Quality Achievements**: Zero breaking changes, sub-millisecond response times, comprehensive testing
*   **âœ… UI/UX Enhancement**: Strike Bitcoin ultra-dark theme applied across monitoring systems
