## 2025-01-27 | Design System Architecture Learning Pattern

**Pattern Type**: Technical Architecture - Frontend Design Systems  
**Trigger**: Persistent icon overlap issue in chat header  
**Learning**: When patch fixes repeatedly fail, the issue is usually fundamental architecture, not surface-level styling  

**Key Insights Captured**:
1. **Root Cause Recognition**: Multiple failed patches indicate architectural problems, not spacing issues
2. **PWA Compliance**: Existing knowledge (BitAgora responsive design doc) wasn't transferred to new project
3. **Component Architecture**: Monolithic components with complex CSS are fragile; composable components with systematic design tokens are robust
4. **Decision Framework**: Clear criteria for "patch vs. rebuild" decisions prevent wasted development time

**System Intelligence Update**:
- Added Design System Learning Log for real-time capture of frontend architecture lessons
- Enhanced component architecture guidelines with PWA compliance checklist
- Integrated pattern recognition for when to escalate from patches to fundamental redesign
