# AVCA-DIAS Development Log

## Session: Phase 0 Complete - E2E Validation
*Date: January 28, 2025*

### Phase 0 Results ✅
- **Objective**: Validate AVCA pipeline end-to-end
- **Result**: CONDITIONAL GO - 3/4 criteria passed
- **Blocker**: Cost exceeded budget ($2.84 vs $0.50 target)
- **Solution**: Model optimization (83% cost reduction possible)

### Tasks Completed
1. **P0.1**: Created feature specification for "Add Search to Dashboard"
2. **P0.2**: Implemented token tracking system with budgets
3. **P0.3**: Built cost monitoring dashboard component
4. **P0.4**: Created quality measurement system (5 dimensions)
5. **P0.5**: Executed E2E pipeline test - all 8 stages successful
6. **P0.6**: Analyzed results, identified cost optimization path
7. **P0.7**: Created Go/No-Go decision report

### Key Metrics
- **Time**: 16.5s (98% faster than 30min target)
- **Quality**: 93% (exceeds 90% target)
- **Manual**: 13% intervention (under 20% target)
- **Cost**: $2.84 → $0.48 projected (after optimization)

### Next Phase Preparation
- **Phase 1**: Microservices Architecture (after cost optimization)
- **Timeline**: 4 days for optimization, then 5 days for Phase 1
- **Focus**: Event bus, service decomposition, static analysis
