# Continuity of Context

**Last Updated**: 2024-07-22

**Purpose**: This is the master context file for this project. Its purpose is to allow any AI assistant to quickly understand the project's current state, goals, and your role, ensuring seamless and context-aware collaboration across multiple sessions.

## Current Status

We have successfully completed a "hard reset" of the project blueprinting phase. An initial misunderstanding of the project's scope—believing it to be a simple code generator instead of a comprehensive SaaS platform—was identified. After a thorough review of the documents in `Concept-&-Inspiration`, the project's true vision was understood.

The incorrect blueprint files were deleted, and the original templates within `00-Blueprint/` have been updated to serve as the definitive architectural plan. These documents now accurately describe the MVP for the Vibe Lab SaaS platform, which features:

- A multi-page workspace including a `Dashboard`, `Blueprints` page, and `Build` page.
- A user experience centered around a persistent AI chat panel.
- A "Push-to-GitHub" model for the initial code delivery, deferring the complexity of a real-time local agent.

The project's high-level architecture is now correctly defined and ready for implementation.

## Next Actions

The immediate next step is to begin the **implementation phase**. The plan is as follows:

1.  **Scaffold the Next.js Application**: Initialize a new Next.js project configured with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
2.  **Implement Core Layout**: Build the main application structure, including the persistent navigation sidebar and the AI chat panel (`<AppLayout />`).
3.  **Set up Authentication**: Integrate `NextAuth.js` with the GitHub OAuth provider to handle user sessions.
4.  **Build Core Pages**: Create the basic structure for the `Dashboard`, `Blueprints`, and `Build` pages.
