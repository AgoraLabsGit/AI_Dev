## 🚦 Decision Points

### After Roadmap 1
- **Go/No-Go**: Are foundations stable enough?
- **Options**: Continue to Roadmap 2 or additional stabilization

### After Roadmap 2
- **Decision**: Focus on UX or jump to production features?
- **Options**: Roadmap 3 (recommended) or Roadmap 4 (if rushing to market)

### After Roadmap 3
- **Decision**: Production deployment or more features?
- **Options**: Roadmap 4 (recommended) or selective Roadmap 5 features

## 💡 Quick Start Guide

### For Project Managers
1. Start with Roadmap 1 (non-negotiable)
2. Plan resources for 10-month journey
3. Set up weekly progress reviews
4. Use TaskMaster for detailed tracking

### For Developers
1. Review current codebase state
2. Familiarize with disconnected systems
3. Start with cleanup tasks
4. Document findings as you go

### For TaskMaster Integration
1. Import roadmap structure
2. Break down stories into tasks
3. Add time estimates
4. Set up dependencies
5. Begin sprint planning

## 🎯 Critical Path

**Must Complete in Order**:
1. Roadmap 1, Phase 1B (Integration Fixes) - Blocks everything
2. Roadmap 2, Phase 2A (DIAS Activation) - Unlocks AI capabilities
3. Roadmap 3, Phase 3A (Navigation) - Required for user flows
4. Roadmap 4, Phase 4A (Security) - Required for production

**Can Parallelize**:
- Roadmap 3 UI components (after navigation)
- Roadmap 4 documentation (anytime)
- Roadmap 5 research tasks (early start)

## 📈 Value Delivery Timeline

```
Week 4-6:   Working AI integration (Roadmap 1)
Week 8-10:  Component generation live (Roadmap 2)
Week 14-16: Beautiful UI/UX (Roadmap 3)
Week 20-22: Production deployment (Roadmap 4)
Week 30-40: Advanced features (Roadmap 5)
```

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Service Integration Failures**: Mitigated by Roadmap 1 focus
- **Performance Issues**: Addressed in Roadmap 4
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Covered in Roadmap 4

### Resource Risks
- **Developer Availability**: Can scale some roadmaps
- **Skill Gaps**: Training built into timeline
- **Budget Constraints**: Roadmaps are modular

### Strategic Risks
- **Market Changes**: Roadmaps allow pivoting
- **Competition**: Fast track to Roadmap 3 if needed
- **User Adoption**: Early feedback loops built in
