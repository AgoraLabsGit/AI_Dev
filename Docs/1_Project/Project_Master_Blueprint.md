# 01 - Vibe Lab Product Master Blueprint
**Business Context, Requirements, and Roadmap**

---

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

### Vision
Transform software development through an intelligent, Strike-inspired multi-agent platform that guides developers through a strategic, AI-powered lifecycle: **Import â†’ Design â†’ Build â†’ Deploy**.

The platform serves as an AI co-pilot that transforms high-level concepts into production-ready codebases through AVCA (AI-guided Visual Component Architecture) and DIAS (Development Intelligence Analysis System).

### Business Goals
1. **Accelerate Development**: Reduce project setup and component creation time by 80%
2. **Improve Code Quality**: Maintain 95%+ architecture compliance through AI auditing
3. **Enable Non-Developers**: Allow business stakeholders to participate in technical planning
4. **Market Leadership**: Become the standard for AI-assisted software architecture

### Success Metrics
- **10,000 active monthly users** by end of year
- **90%+ blueprint-to-deployment success rate**
- **<5 second** response time for AI-powered features
- **8.5/10+ user satisfaction** with AI assistance quality

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Solo Developers**: Building personal projects and startups
- **Small Development Teams**: 2-5 person teams needing structure
- **Technical Founders**: Non-developers who need to communicate with developers

### Secondary Users  
- **Enterprise Development Teams**: Looking for standardized architecture
- **Agencies**: Building multiple client projects with consistent quality
- **Educators**: Teaching software architecture and best practices

## 3. Core Features & Requirements

### Must-Have Features (Current Implementation)
1. **Multi-Project Management**: Dashboard with project overview and metrics
2. **Stage 0 - Import & Analysis**: GitHub repository analysis and migration planning
3. **Stage 1 - Blueprints**: Project requirements and user story definition
4. **Stage 2 - Styling**: Strike-inspired theme and design system management
5. **Stage 3 - Pages**: Page layouts and user flow definition
6. **Stage 4 - Components**: 224-component library with template variations
7. **AVCA Pipeline**: Stages 5-8 for code generation and quality assurance
8. **DIAS Intelligence**: AI insights, pattern recognition, and recommendations
9. **Multi-Agent System**: Developer + Auditor AI coordination
10. **Pure Tailwind Architecture**: Zero custom CSS, component-local styling

### Architecture Requirements
- **Strike Bitcoin Aesthetic**: Ultra-dark theme (#0A0A0B) with clean hierarchy
- **Cursor/Linear Layout**: Efficient navigation with keyboard shortcuts
- **Project Context Routing**: `/project/[id]/...` for multi-project support
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress tracking and AI status indicators
- **AVCA/DIAS Integration**: AI-powered architecture compliance and generation

## 4. Technology & Business Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Pure Tailwind Only**: No custom CSS files, modules, or design systems allowed
- **Next.js/TypeScript**: Frontend framework requirements
- **PostgreSQL/Prisma**: Database requirements for project persistence
- **GitHub Integration**: Core workflow requirement for deployment
- **Sub-second Response**: AI interactions must be highly responsive

### Business Constraints
- **Bootstrap Phase**: Limited initial budget, focus on MVP features
- **Solo Development**: Single developer building system initially
- **Self-Validation**: Must use own system to build itself (eat our own dog food)

### Compliance Requirements
- **Architecture Validation**: All code must pass DIAS compliance checks
- **Security Standards**: Claude Auditor must approve all generated code
- **Performance Targets**: <5s page loads, <100ms UI interactions

## 5. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current - 35% Complete)
- âœ… AVCA/DIAS core architecture
- âœ… Multi-project dashboard
- âœ… Stage 0 import system
- âœ… Basic Design stages (1-4)
- ðŸ”„ Blueprint system completion
- ðŸ”„ Pure Tailwind compliance audit

### Phase 2: Intelligence Enhancement (Next)
- DIAS pattern recognition improvements
- Advanced component template system
- Real-time collaboration features
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Local agent integration (Model B)
- Team collaboration tools
- Advanced deployment options
- Enterprise features

### Phase 4: Scale & Polish
- Full web IDE capabilities (Model C)
- Advanced AI features
- Marketplace integration
- Global availability

## 6. Revolutionary Development Philosophy

**Core Principle**: "Use the system to build the system"

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Blueprint-Driven**: Every feature starts with proper blueprints
- **AI-Augmented**: AVCA/DIAS guide all development decisions
- **Architecture-First**: Pure Tailwind, component isolation, zero conflicts
- **Self-Validating**: System validates its own development process

**Success Validation**: 
If Vibe Lab can successfully build and maintain itself using its own blueprint and AI systems, it proves the platform's effectiveness for all users.
