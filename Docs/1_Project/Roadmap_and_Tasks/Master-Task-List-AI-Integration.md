## Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path (Sequential Dependencies)
1. **P2.1.1** (AI Orchestrator) → **P2.1.2-5** (MCP Servers) → **P2.2.1** (Conversational Interface) → **P3.1.1** (AVCA Integration) → **T2.1.1** (E2E Testing)

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Track 1**: P2.1.1 → P2.2.2 (TaskMaster) → P4.1.2 (Git Integration)
- **Track 2**: P2.1.1 → P2.1.6 (Context Manager) → P2.3.1-3 (Memory Layers)
- **Track 3**: Testing preparation can begin as soon as components are ready

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **P2.1.1** (AI Orchestrator) - Blocks 15+ other tasks
2. **P2.1.6** (Context Manager) - Critical for memory and caching
3. **P3.1.1** (AVCA Integration) - Required for all integration testing

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Team Structure
1. **Core AI Team** (2-3 developers)
   - Focus: P2.1.1, P2.1.6, P2.2.1
   - Skills: TypeScript, AI integration, system architecture

2. **MCP Integration Team** (2 developers)
   - Focus: P2.1.2-5 (MCP Servers)
   - Skills: API integration, specific MCP knowledge

## Timeline Estimation

### Phase 2 (DIAS Core): 6-8 weeks
- Week 1-2: AI Orchestrator + Context Manager
- Week 3-4: MCP Servers + Intelligence Modules start
- Week 5-6: Complete Intelligence Modules
- Week 7-8: Memory & Adaptation systems

### Phase 3 (Integration): 2-3 weeks
- Can partially overlap with Phase 2 completion

### Phase 4 (Automation): 1 week
- Can run in parallel with Phase 3

### Testing Phases: 4-5 weeks
- T1: Runs alongside development (continuous)
- T2: 2-3 weeks after integration
- T3: 1 week final validation

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 10-12 weeks with parallel execution

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **Context Manager Compression**: Must avoid previous failed approach
   - Mitigation: Research and prototype new compression methods early
   
2. **MCP Server Integration**: External dependencies
   - Mitigation: Build abstraction layer, implement fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance Baselines**: 0-4ms response time requirement
   - Mitigation: Continuous performance testing, early optimization

### Process Risks
1. **Complex Dependencies**: Many interconnected tasks
   - Mitigation: Daily standup focused on blockers, clear communication

2. **Testing Coverage**: Ensuring comprehensive validation
   - Mitigation: Test-driven development, automated test suite from start
