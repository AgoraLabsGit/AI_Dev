## 2. User Stories (MVP)

### **User Account Management & Authentication**
- **As a** user, **I want to** be able to create an account and log in **so that** I can manage my projects securely.
- **As a** user, **I want to** be able to connect my GitHub account **so that** Vibe Lab can create repositories on my behalf.

### **Project Dashboard & Management**
- **As a** user, **I want to** see all of my projects on a central dashboard **so that** I can easily track my work.
- **As a** user, **I want to** be able to create a new project from the dashboard **so that** I can start the blueprinting process.

### **Guided Blueprinting Workflow**
- **As a** user, **I want to** be guided through a structured process of creating blueprint documents **so that** I can establish a strong architectural foundation.
- **As a** user, **I want to** interact with an AI via a chat interface to fill out the blueprint documents **so that** the process is collaborative and intuitive.

### **Component Roadmap Generation**
- **As a** user, **I want** the AI to analyze my completed blueprints and generate a roadmap of core components to build **so that** I have a clear plan for creating my system's "Lego blocks."

### **Foundational Documentation Synthesis**
- **As a** user, **I want to** trigger a `GENERATE FOUNDATION` command **so that** the AI can synthesize my blueprints and roadmap into a set of comprehensive, code-backed TIER-1 documents.

### **Push-to-GitHub Integration**
- **As a** user, **I want** the application to push the generated foundation, roadmap, and scaffolded code to a new GitHub repository **so that** I can immediately clone it and begin local development.
