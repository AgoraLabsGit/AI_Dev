# Vibe Lab SaaS - Project Roadmap (MVP)

## Introduction
This document outlines the strategic development roadmap for the Vibe Lab SaaS Minimum Viable Product (MVP) following the **Plan → Build → Test → Visualize** framework with Linear-inspired UI and multi-agent AI architecture. The goal is to build the core features necessary to validate the platform's value proposition with both developers and non-developers.

**Key Framework Elements**:
- **Multi-Agent System**: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Developer) + Claude 3 Opus (Auditor) + Task Master
- **UI Inspiration**: Linear three-column layout with Command Palette (Cmd+K)
- **Navigation**: Plan, Build, Test, Visualize pages
- **Task Master**: Enhanced project management with complexity scoring and wave orchestration

    *   Build interactive blueprint editor with real-time AI assistance.
    *   Integrate multi-agent chat UI with Developer/Auditor indicators.
    *   Implement roadmap generation trigger and status tracking.
*   **2.3. Build Page (/project/{projectId}/build):**
    *   Create Task Complexity Matrix component with sortable columns.
    *   Implement dependency graph visualization using vis-network.
    *   Build resource allocation and wave orchestration displays.
*   **2.4. Enhanced AI Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Implement **Pattern D: Task Master Integration** workflow from AI architecture.
    *   Build Task Master analysis pipeline with complexity scoring and MCP optimization.
    *   Create real-time status updates for multi-agent coordination.

## Phase 3: Test & Visualize Pages + AI Backend (Estimated: Week 5-6)
*Goal: Complete the Plan→Build→Test→Visualize workflow with full multi-agent backend integration.*

*   **3.1. AI Orchestrator Backend:**
    *   Build SuperClaude/ClaudeCode orchestration service with multi-agent coordination.
    *   Implement Pattern A-D workflows (Sequential Review, Parallel Analysis, Checkpoint Reviews, Task Master Integration).
    *   Create background job system for long-running AI operations.
*   **3.2. Test Page (/project/{projectId}/test):**
    *   Build foundation review interface with Claude Auditor integration.
    *   Implement quality gates and validation criteria display.
    *   Create audit results visualization with actionable recommendations.
*   **3.3. Visualize Page (/project/{projectId}/visualize):**
    *   Build code preview with syntax highlighting and file tree navigation.
    *   Implement GitHub integration with repository creation workflow.
    *   Create Development Log display with project decision history.
*   **3.4. Enhanced Agent Coordination:**
    *   Implement real-time agent status streaming with SSE events.
    *   Build agent handoff mechanisms and validation checkpoints.
    *   Create failure recovery and fallback strategies.

## Phase 4: Polish, Testing & MVP Launch (Estimated: Week 7)
*Goal: Complete Linear-inspired UI polish, comprehensive testing, and production deployment.*

*   **4.1. Linear UI Polish:**
    *   Perfect keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys, Cmd+K) across all pages.
    *   Implement Command Palette shortcuts for all major actions.
    *   Refine three-column layout responsiveness and state management.
    *   Add agent status indicators and smooth transitions between Developer/Auditor modes.
*   **4.2. Task Master & Wave Mode Testing:**
    *   Test Task Master complexity scoring accuracy with real project data.
    *   Validate wave orchestration strategies and checkpoint mechanisms.
    *   Verify MCP server coordination and resource allocation algorithms.
*   **4.3. End-to-End Workflow Validation:**
