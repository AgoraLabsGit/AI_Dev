# Continuity of Context - Vibe Lab AVCA-DIAS System

## Overview
This document maintains continuity of critical insights, decisions, and learnings across the AVCA-DIAS system development and hardening process.

## Latest Update: August 1, 2025 - Reference Implementation Created ðŸ”„

### Major Achievement
- **âœ… Reference Implementation**: Created clean backup of AVCA/DIAS core implementation
- **âœ… Directory Structure**: Added fourth core directory `vibe-lab-reference`
- **âœ… Code Preservation**: Captured pre-integration state of core systems

### Current Progress
- **âœ… Core System Updates**: 
  - AVCA Core: Preserved in reference implementation
  - DIAS Core: Preserved in reference implementation
  - Integration Layer: Core components preserved
  - Directory Structure: Enhanced with reference backup

### Next Steps
1. Continue with frontend implementation following complete-onboarding-implementation-roadmap.md
2. Proceed with Vibe Lab-specific development in `vibe-lab-product`
3. Use reference implementation as comparison point for Phase 4.5 extraction
4. Maintain separation between core and product-specific code
