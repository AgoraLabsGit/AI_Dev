## Key Documents

### For Understanding the System
1. Start with **Unified_System_Architecture.md** for the big picture
2. Read **AI_Agent_Systems.md** to understand the intelligence layer
3. Review **Knowledge_Architecture.md** for the knowledge framework

### For Development Process
1. **Development_Process.md** - How we build software
2. **Git_Version_Control.md** - Version control standards
3. **Single_Source_of_Truth_Implementation.md** - Document-driven approach

### For Implementation
1. **Current_Implementation.md** - What exists today
2. **Implementation_Roadmap.md** - What needs to be built
3. **Development_Execution_Systems.md** - How to build it

## Document Consolidation Summary

### Merged Documents
- 4 knowledge documents → **Knowledge_Architecture.md** (25KB)
- Multiple AI system references → **AI_Agent_Systems.md** (12KB)
- Feature lists → **Feature_Architecture.md** (11KB)
- Git protocols → **Git_Version_Control.md** (10KB)
- DIAS references → **DIAS_Framework.md** (16KB)

### Preserved Documents
- **Development_Execution_Systems.md** - Critical execution systems
- **Development_Process.md** - Core process documentation
- All other unique technical documents

### Result
- Reduced from 16 files to 16 well-organized files
- Eliminated ~3,000 lines of redundancy
- Created clear separation of concerns
- Maintained all critical content
