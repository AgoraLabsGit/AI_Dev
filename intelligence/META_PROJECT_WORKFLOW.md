# Vibe Lab - Meta-Project Development Workflow

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: July 28, 2025

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the corrected, context-aware development workflow for the **Vibe Lab SaaS Platform** project. It represents a necessary deviation from the standard workflow described in the `Human_Operating_Manual.md`.

The standard workflow is optimized for building typical software applications. However, because this project's goal is to build the Vibe Lab system itself, a different sequence is required to ensure strategic alignment before detailed documentation is generated.

## 2. Corrected Workflow Phases

### Phase I: Blueprinting
*   **Command**: `BEGIN BLUEPRINT`
*   **Outcome**: The collaborative creation of the core project blueprint documents in the `00-Blueprint/` directory.
*   **Status**: Complete.

### Phase II: Project Roadmap Generation (Deviation)
*   **Command**: Instruct the AI to generate the `Project_Roadmap.md` file.
*   **Rationale**: For this meta-project, a high-level strategic roadmap must be established *before* generating comprehensive documentation. This roadmap will define the build-out sequence for the Vibe Lab SaaS platform itself (e.g., what core features of the Vibe Lab system to build first).
*   **Status**: This is the **immediate next step**.

### Phase III: Generate Foundation
*   **Command**: `GENERATE FOUNDATION`
*   **Outcome**: The generation of the **Tier 1 (Comprehensive)** documentation. This phase now proceeds *after* the strategic roadmap is approved.
*   **Status**: Pending.

### Phase IV: Generate Scaffold
*   **Command**: `GENERATE SCAFFOLD`
*   **Outcome**: The generation of **Tier 2 (Quick Summaries)** and **Tier 3 (Patterns & Templates)**. The `Project_Roadmap.md` will have already been created in Phase II.
*   **Status**: Pending.

### Phase V: Vibe Coding
*   **Status**: Pending.
*   **Description**: Open-ended development begins, guided by the now-complete roadmap and documentation.

## 3. Conclusion
This corrected workflow should be considered the guiding process for the Vibe Lab SaaS project. All development and supervisory activities should adhere to this sequence.
