# Vibe Lab Preview Feature

## Overview
Real-time application preview system using Vercel Edge Runtime for instant deployments and live feedback.

## Core Features

### 1. Live Preview Environment
- Instant preview deployments via Vercel Edge
- Sandboxed iframe environment
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- 30-minute preview lifetime with auto-cleanup

### 2. Preview Interface
```typescript
interface PreviewFeatures {
  core: {
    livePreview: "Sandboxed iframe preview";
    deviceSimulation: "Responsive testing modes";
    styleInspector: "Real-time Tailwind inspection";
    performanceMonitor: "Core Web Vitals tracking";
  };
  
  controls: {
    deviceSelector: "Mobile, tablet, desktop views";
    templateSwitch: "Switch between style templates";
    shareButton: "Generate shareable preview URL";
    refreshTrigger: "Manual preview refresh";
  };
}
```

### 3. Integration Points
- Direct connection to AVCA pipeline output
- DIAS real-time quality monitoring
- Tailwind class validation
- Performance metrics collection

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Preview Deployment
```typescript
interface PreviewDeployment {
  trigger: "AVCA pipeline completion";
  process: [
    "Package generated code",
    "Deploy to edge runtime",
    "Generate preview URL",
    "Initialize monitoring"
  ];
  cleanup: "Automatic after 30 minutes";
}
```

### 2. Security & Isolation
- Content Security Policy enforcement
- Restricted execution environment
- Resource usage limits
- Cross-origin isolation

### 3. Monitoring & Feedback
- Real-time style analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- DIAS quality validation
- Error reporting

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Preview (MVP)
- Basic preview environment setup
- Iframe implementation

- Monitoring services

### Development
- Frontend: 2 weeks
- Backend: 1 week
- Testing: 1 week
- Integration: 1 week

## Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Resource Usage**
   - Risk: Excessive preview environments
   - Mitigation: Strict lifetime limits, cleanup

2. **Performance**
   - Risk: Slow preview generation
   - Mitigation: Edge deployment, caching

3. **Security**
   - Risk: Unsafe code execution
   - Mitigation: Strict sandboxing, CSP

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**

   - Implement basic iframe component
   - Create deployment pipeline

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Vercel Edge Runtime configuration
   - WebSocket implementation
   - Monitoring setup

3. **Documentation Needs**
   - Technical specifications
   - User documentation
   - API documentation
