# Vibe Lab Meta Documentation Index

## Overview
This index provides a comprehensive guide to all meta-process documentation for Vibe Lab. The meta directory captures how we're building Vibe Lab using its own systems.

## Directory Structure

### 📁 `/logs`
Development tracking and progress logs:
- **COC.md**: Continuity of Context - Current state and next actions
- **development-progress.md**: Comprehensive progress tracking (PRIMARY)
- **dev_logs.md**: Detailed development session logs

### 📁 `/process`
How we build Vibe Lab:
- **meta-process-overview.md**: The self-building concept and phases
- **development-methodology.md**: Our development approach and patterns
- **phase0-decision-report.md**: E2E validation and cost optimization decisions
- **avca-002-stage1-summary.md**: AI Client base implementation details
- **avca-002-stage2-summary.md**: Rate limiting and retry implementation

### 📁 `/learning`
What we've learned:
- **cost-optimization-report.md**: How we achieved 91% cost reduction
- **key-learnings.md**: Comprehensive learnings across all areas

### 📁 `/blueprints`
Blueprint patterns and tracking:
- **blueprint-tracking.md**: All generated blueprints and patterns

### 📁 Root Level
Project management:
- **comprehensive_taskmaster.md**: Detailed task breakdown (8 phases)
- **roadmap_status.md**: Concise project status
- **README.md**: Meta directory purpose

## Quick Navigation Guide

### For Project Status
1. Start with `roadmap_status.md` for high-level view
2. Check `logs/development-progress.md` for detailed metrics
3. Review `logs/COC.md` for immediate next steps

### For Technical Details
1. Read `process/development-methodology.md` for approach
2. Check specific stage summaries in `/process`
3. Review `learning/key-learnings.md` for insights

### For Task Planning
1. Use `comprehensive_taskmaster.md` for full task list
2. Check `logs/dev_logs.md` for recent completions
3. Plan using patterns in `blueprints/blueprint-tracking.md`

### For Meta-Process Understanding
1. Start with `process/meta-process-overview.md`
2. Understand phases and self-building concept
3. Track progress toward self-hosting

## Key Documents by Purpose

### 🎯 Primary Progress Tracking
- `logs/development-progress.md` - Single source of truth

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions
- `process/development-methodology.md` - Key patterns
- `process/avca-002-stage1-summary.md` - AI architecture
- `process/avca-002-stage2-summary.md` - Resilience patterns

### 💰 Cost Management
- `process/phase0-decision-report.md` - Initial cost analysis
- `learning/cost-optimization-report.md` - Optimization success

### 📊 Metrics and Quality
- `logs/development-progress.md#metrics-dashboard` - All metrics
- `learning/key-learnings.md#testing-strategies` - Quality approach

### 🔮 Future Planning
- `process/meta-process-overview.md#future-meta-process-vision`
- `blueprints/blueprint-tracking.md#future-blueprint-templates`

## Update Protocol

When making progress:
1. Update `logs/COC.md` with current state
2. Update `logs/development-progress.md` with metrics
3. Update `comprehensive_taskmaster.md` with task status
4. Update `roadmap_status.md` with phase progress
5. Add session notes to `logs/dev_logs.md`

When completing major milestones:
1. Create summary in `/process`
2. Extract learnings to `/learning`
3. Document blueprints in `/blueprints`
4. Update this index if needed

## Meta-Process Maturity

### Current State (Phase 1)
- **Meta Level**: 0 (traditional development)
- **Automation**: 0% (all manual)
- **Self-Hosting**: Not yet started

### Target State (Phase 4.5)
- **Meta Level**: 2 (full self-hosting)
- **Automation**: 80% (pipeline-driven)
- **Self-Hosting**: Vibe Lab building itself

### Vision (Phase 8)
- **Meta Level**: 3+ (self-improving)
- **Automation**: 95% (human architects only)
- **Self-Hosting**: Continuous evolution
