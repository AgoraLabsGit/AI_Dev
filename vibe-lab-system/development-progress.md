# AVCA-DIAS Development Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the complete development progress of the AVCA-DIAS system from inception through production deployment. It serves as the primary reference for completed work, test results, decisions made, and upcoming milestones.

**Project Start Date**: January 26, 2025  
**Current Status**: Phase 1 In Progress  
**Overall Progress**: 15% (1.2/8 phases complete)

---

## Phase 0: Minimal Vertical Slice (COMPLETE ✅)

### Objective
Validate the AVCA pipeline end-to-end with a simple feature to prove technical viability and establish baseline metrics.

### Timeline
- **Started**: January 28, 2025
- **Completed**: January 28, 2025
- **Duration**: 1 day

### Test Feature
**"Add Search to Dashboard"** - A representative feature requiring:
- 5 components (SearchBar, SearchInput, SearchResults, useSearch hook, SearchResult type)
- UI implementation
- Logic implementation
- Data patterns
- Integration

### Implementation Summary

#### 1. Infrastructure Created

| Component | File | Purpose | Status |

#### 2. Initial Test Results (Pre-Optimization)

**Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Test ID**: e2e-test-1753739654609

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Time | <30 min | 16.5s | ✅ PASS |
| Cost | <$0.50 | $2.84 | ❌ FAIL |
| Quality | >90% | 93% | ✅ PASS |
| Manual | <20% | 13% | ✅ PASS |

**Issue Identified**: Cost 5.7x over budget due to exclusive use of Claude Opus

#### 3. Cost Optimization Implementation

**Approach**: Multi-model strategy
- **Haiku**: Simple operations (ideation, blueprints, styling, registry, assembly)
- **Sonnet**: Complex tasks (page designs, component specs, code generation, verification)
- **Opus**: Reserved for critical security audits

**Implementation Files**:
- `lib/avca/model-config.ts` - Model selection configuration
- `scripts/test-cost-optimization.ts` - Validation script
- `lib/avca/cost-optimization-report.md` - Analysis report

#### 4. Final Test Results (Post-Optimization)

**Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Test ID**: e2e-test-1753742461834

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Time | <30 min | 16.5s | ✅ PASS | No change |
| Cost | <$0.50 | $0.29 | ✅ PASS | -89.8% |
| Quality | >90% | 93% | ✅ PASS | No change |
| Manual | <20% | 13% | ✅ PASS | No change |

### Key Achievements

1. **Pipeline Validation**: All 8 AVCA stages executed successfully
2. **Cost Reduction**: $2.84 → $0.29 (89.8% savings)
3. **Quality Maintained**: 93% quality score preserved
4. **Token Efficiency**: 55,700 → 33,600 tokens (40% reduction)

### Technical Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Multi-model architecture | Balance cost vs quality | 89.8% cost reduction |
| Sonnet for verification | Opus too expensive for all checks | Saved $0.245/feature |
| Token optimization | Reduce prompt sizes | 40% token reduction |
| Haiku for simple tasks | Simple operations don't need Opus | 94% cost reduction per stage |

### Lessons Learned

1. **Model Selection Matters**: Right model for right task dramatically reduces costs
2. **Token Efficiency**: Careful prompt engineering can significantly reduce usage
3. **Quality Preservation**: Cheaper models can maintain quality with proper prompts
4. **Pipeline Viability**: 8-stage pipeline works end-to-end as designed

#### Deliverables Created

| Component | File | Description | Status |
|-----------|------|-------------|--------|
| Base Service | `lib/avca/services/base-service.ts` | Abstract base class for all microservices | ✅ |
| Event Bus | `lib/avca/services/event-bus.ts` | Pub/sub messaging with retry and DLQ | ✅ |

#### Architecture Features Implemented

1. **Base Service Class**
   - Health checks with configurable intervals
   - Metrics collection (requests, errors, response time)
   - Event emission for monitoring
   - Graceful startup/shutdown

2. **Event Bus**
   - Topic-based pub/sub
   - Message queuing when no subscribers
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queue for failed messages
   - Subscription filtering

3. **Service Registry**
   - Service registration/deregistration
   - Health monitoring with auto-deregister
   - Load balancing (round-robin)
   - Dependency checking
   - Metrics aggregation

4. **Blueprint Service**
   - Implements base service pattern
   - Integrates with token tracking
   - Uses model configuration
   - Template-based blueprint generation

#### Test Results

**Microservices Architecture Test**: ✅ PASSED

```
1. Service Registry: Started successfully
2. Blueprint Service: Registered as blueprint-service-1
3. Service Discovery: Found 1 healthy instance
4. Event Bus: Message delivery confirmed
5. Blueprint Processing: Generated in 1501ms, cost $0.0016
6. Registry Metrics: 1 service, 1 instance
7. Event Bus Metrics: 0 messages in DLQ
8. Cleanup: All services stopped gracefully
```

#### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Event-driven architecture | Loose coupling between services |
| Health checks mandatory | Ensures system reliability |
| Retry with backoff | Handles transient failures |
| Service registry pattern | Enables dynamic scaling |
| Base service abstraction | Consistency across services |
