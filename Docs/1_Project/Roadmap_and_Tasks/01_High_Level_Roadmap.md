# High-Level Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major development phases for Vibe Lab, transitioning from a core MVP to a comprehensive platform serving both new projects and the enhancement of existing codebases.

---

## Phase 1: Core MVP (Weeks 1-7)

**Goal**: Build the foundational platform for generating high-quality new projects from scratch.

*   **Key Features**:
    *   "Fresh Project" onboarding path.
    *   Core three-agent AI system (Router, Developer, Auditor).
    *   AVCA pipeline for code generation.
    *   DIAS for initial learning and adaptation.
    *   In-app code preview and GitHub integration.

## Phase 2: Targeted Enhancement (Weeks 8-10)

**Goal**: Expand the platform to serve freelancers and consultants by adding features to analyze, improve, and modernize existing codebases.

*   **Key Features**:
    *   New "Targeted Enhancement" onboarding path (import from GitHub).
    *   **Codebase Analyst Agent**: An AI specialized in dependency mapping, architecture visualization, and technical debt assessment.
    *   **Legacy Modernizer Agent**: An AI specialized in safe dependency upgrades and framework migration.
    *   Enhanced "Plan" page with architecture diagrams and risk assessment tools.

## Phase 3: Optimization & Launch (Weeks 11-12)

**Goal**: Prepare the platform for a public launch by focusing on performance, scalability, and user experience.

*   **Key Features**:
    *   Performance tuning of all critical paths.
    *   Implementation of the Vercel Edge live preview feature.
    *   Refinement of the user interface and onboarding experience.
    *   Implementation of pricing tiers and subscription management.

## Future: Desktop Application

A longer-term goal is the migration of the Vibe Lab web application into a native desktop experience using Electron. This will provide deeper OS integration, offline capabilities, and enhanced performance. The detailed plan for this is in `Docs/1_Project/Roadmap_and_Tasks/02_Future_Roadmap_Desktop_App.md`.
