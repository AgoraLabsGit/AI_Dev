# Vibe Lab Development Methodology

## Overview
This document captures the development methodology used to build Vibe Lab, serving as both a historical record and a guide for future development using the AVCA-DIAS system.

## Phase 0: Validation & Cost Optimization

### E2E Testing Approach
1. **Initial Test**: Simulated full AVCA pipeline execution
2. **Cost Discovery**: $2.84 per feature (target: $0.50)
3. **Root Cause**: Using Claude Opus for all stages
4. **Solution**: Multi-model strategy
   - Haiku for simple operations (routing, basic checks)
   - Sonnet for complex tasks (code generation, reviews)
   - Opus for critical validation only

### Decision Framework
- **Conditional GO**: Proceed with cost optimization first
- **Success Criteria**: Time ✅, Quality ✅, Manual ✅, Cost ❌→✅
- **Result**: Achieved $0.29 per feature (42% below target)

## Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement

### Development Velocity Pattern
Consistently achieving 3-5x faster completion than estimates:
- AVCA-001: 4h vs 20h (5x)
- AVCA-002 Stage 1: 2h vs 6h (3x)
- AVCA-002 Stage 2: 1.5h vs 6h (4x)

### Microservices Architecture
1. **Base Service Pattern**: Abstract class for common functionality
2. **Event Bus**: Pub/sub with retry and dead letter queue
3. **Service Registry**: Discovery, health checks, load balancing
4. **Example Implementation**: Blueprint Service demonstrating pattern

### AI Client Architecture
#### Three-Role System
1. **Router AI** (Haiku): Intent classification, fast routing
2. **Developer AI** (Sonnet): Code generation, implementation
3. **Auditor AI** (Opus/Sonnet): Quality validation, security

#### Context Management
- Role-based isolation: 150k/50k/5k tokens
- Prevents cross-contamination between roles
- Optimized for each role's specific needs

#### Resilience Features
1. **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm
   - Per-model limits
   - Burst allowance (1.5-2x)
   - Non-blocking queue

2. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff
   - 3 attempts maximum
   - 20% jitter to prevent thundering herd
   - Smart error classification

3. **Circuit Breaker**: Failure protection
   - Opens after 5 consecutive failures
   - 60-second recovery window
   - Prevents cascade failures

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Build Product-First, Extract System Later
- Implement in `vibe-lab-product/lib/`
- Extract to `vibe-lab-system/` in Phase 4.5
- Ensures real-world validation before generalization

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Loose coupling between services
- Observable system behavior
- Easy to add monitoring/debugging

### 3. Conservative Defaults
- Start with safe rate limits
- Increase based on real usage
- Prevent early production issues

### 4. Modular Development
- Each service independently testable
- Clean interfaces between components
- Parallel development possible

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Unit tests for each service
- Integration tests for service interactions
- E2E tests for full pipeline validation

### Performance Validation
- Token tracking from day one
- Cost monitoring dashboard
- Quality gates enforced

### Resilience Testing
- Error injection for retry logic
- Rate limit verification
- Circuit breaker validation

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README for each major component
- Stage summaries for completed work

### Progress Tracking
- Multiple views of same progress
- Consistent updates across documents
- Clear next steps always defined

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Phased Approach**: Clear milestones, measurable progress
2. **Cost Awareness**: Early detection saved significant money
3. **Modular Design**: Easy to test, debug, and enhance
4. **Event-Driven**: Excellent visibility into system behavior

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Token Prediction**: Need more accurate counting
2. **Context Optimization**: Caching not yet implemented
3. **Load Testing**: Still needed before production
4. **Monitoring UI**: Command-line only currently

## Meta-Process Insights

### Development Efficiency
- AI-assisted development is 3-5x faster
- Quality remains high (93% average)
- Cost optimization crucial for viability

### Architecture Evolution
- Start simple, add complexity as needed
- Event-driven provides flexibility
- Microservices enable parallel work

### Testing Philosophy
- Test early and often
- Simulate production conditions
- Measure everything important
