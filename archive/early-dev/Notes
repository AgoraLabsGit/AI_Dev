# System Enhancement Notes

## Status Legend:
- ðŸ”„ **REVIEWED** - Analyzed and categorized, ready for next steps
- âœ… **INTEGRATED** - Added to Blueprints/Roadmap/Tasks documentation
- ðŸš€ **IMPLEMENTED** - Completed and working in codebase
- ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - Moved to Future Features (post-MVP)

## Enhancement Ideas:

1. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - Need to create an updated index to Directory structure as it changes
2. âœ… **INTEGRATED** - Need to implement ClaudeCode and Gemini Collaboration system to our Blueprints *(Completed: See Blueprints 09, 13, 15)*
3. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - Need to create an updated feature improvements log for Vibe Lab front end
4. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - Need to automate a lot of our systme intelligence with python scripts
5. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - We need to get the AI Intelligence to periodically review the Directory for:
    a. Good structure and update reference Directory
    b. Code cohesion between all aspects of system
    c. Do a health check on the system. Make sure things like TaskMaster are still working. 
6. ðŸ”„ **REVIEWED** - have Gemini Automatically push review/audits to Claude Code and updates of TaskMaster's tasks.md file. Followed by Human Approval and updates pushed to github Repo. *(Partially implemented, workflow refinement needed)*
7. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - All and all we need to consistently be thinking about automating and optimizing the Vibe Lab functions and work flows. 
8. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - Would be cool to have a project Dashboard that shows how many tasks have been completed. How many lines of codes have been written. What percentage of the project is finished. How many pivots have been made. etc. As much of the AI intelligence that can be displayed to the user on the system and application development as possible. Perhaps this could live at the top of the Roadmaps page (need feedback)
9. ðŸ“… **FUTURE** - Need a quick add feature where user can add notes like the one above to log scattered feature/enhancements to the system and have them automatically integrate into the full Vibe Lab system (blueprints, Docs, Roadmap, Dashboard, Tasks, etc)
10. ðŸ”„ **REVIEWED** - Need to integrate error logging into the system and include into dev feedback. This includes errors that come from localhost server via web logger tool. *(MVP-ready for immediate implementation)*
11. ðŸ”„ **REVIEWED** - Need quick commands. *(Can be implemented as MVP feature)*  

## Tomorrow's Priorities:

1. ðŸ”„ **REVIEWED** - Add docs from Anthropic system for review of missing features/functions. *(Ready for integration)*
2. ðŸ”„ **REVIEWED** - Review Roadmap and tasks.md to get a working UI up and running so development can become more visually driven. *(UI development focus needed)* > Please add the enhancements to our triple tiers
