# Code Audit Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive audit plan for the `vibe-lab-product` codebase. It can be used as a template for periodic, deep-dive reviews of the system to ensure quality, security, and performance.

## 1. Audit Scope

*   **Frontend Application** (`src/app/`, `src/components/`)
*   **AI Services** (`lib/avca/services/`)
*   **Component Pipeline** (`lib/avca/pipeline/`)
*   **Event System** (`lib/dias/`)
*   **Integration Layer** (`lib/integration/`)
*   **Database Schema** (`prisma/`)
*   **API Routes** (`src/app/api/`)
*   **Testing Infrastructure** (`scripts/test-*.ts`)

## 2. Audit Categories

### Security
*   **Objective**: Assess security posture and identify vulnerabilities.
*   **Focus Areas**: API security (auth, keys, rate limiting), data security (DB access, PII), and AI integration security (key protection, prompt injection).

### Performance
*   **Objective**: Evaluate system performance and scalability.
*   **Focus Areas**: Frontend performance (Core Web Vitals, bundle size), backend performance (API response times, DB queries), and AI performance (token usage, cost optimization).

### Code Quality
*   **Objective**: Assess code maintainability, reliability, and best practices.
*   **Focus Areas**: TypeScript implementation (type safety, strict mode), code organization, error handling, and test coverage.

### Architecture
*   **Objective**: Evaluate system design and architectural decisions.
*   **Focus Areas**: Microservices design, event-driven architecture, data architecture, and integration patterns.

### Dependencies
*   **Objective**: Assess third-party dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Focus Areas**: Known vulnerability scanning, outdated package identification, and license compliance.

## 3. Audit Methodology (6-Day Plan)

*   **Day 1: Preparation**: Environment setup and documentation review.
*   **Day 2: Automated Analysis**: Run security scans, performance baselines, and code quality analysis.
*   **Day 3-4: Manual Review**: Deep dive into architecture, security flows, and critical code paths.
*   **Day 5: Testing & Validation**: Functional, load, and stress testing.
*   **Day 6: Reporting**: Compile findings, categorize by severity, and create a remediation plan.

## 4. Success Criteria & Deliverables

*   **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage > 85%, zero TypeScript errors, API response < 100ms, no critical vulnerabilities.
*   **Deliverables**: A comprehensive audit report with detailed findings, a prioritized remediation plan, and a best practices guide for ongoing quality.
