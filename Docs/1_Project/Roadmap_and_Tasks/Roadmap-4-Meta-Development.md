# Roadmap 4: Meta-Development & System Hardening
**Primary Goal**: To use the newly built and tested Vibe Lab AI system to develop, harden, and enhance itself. This phase involves "bootstrapping" our own development by feeding the system our comprehensive documentation and using its intelligence to build its own components.

---

## 1. Phase 1: System Preparation

**Objective**: To create a clean, isolated environment for the meta-development process.

*   **[ ] Task 1.1: Create Clean Implementation Copy**
    *   [ ] Create a new, clean branch or copy of the `vibe-lab-product` codebase. This copy will contain the completed and tested DIAS/AVCA backend from Roadmap 2 & 3.
*   **[ ] Task 1.2: Prepare Documentation Corpus**
    *   [ ] Verify that the entire `/Docs` directory is pristine, up-to-date, and ready for ingestion.

## 2. Phase 2: AI-Driven Frontend Development

**Objective**: To use the Vibe Lab intelligence engine to build out its own frontend UI, based on the specifications in our documentation.

*   **[ ] Task 2.1: Ingest Vibe Lab Documentation**
    *   [ ] Feed the entire `/Docs` directory into the DIAS system, specifically targeting the `Context7` (documentation/research) server. The system should parse and index all our vision, architecture, process, and UI/UX documents.
*   **[ ] Task 2.2: Generate Core UI Blueprints**
    *   [ ] Using the `strategist` and `architect` personas, instruct the system to analyze the ingested documentation (especially the `UI_UX_Guide.md` and page-specific docs) and generate high-level blueprints for the core Vibe Lab application pages (e.g., Dashboard, Onboarding, Projects, Settings).
*   **[ ] Task 2.3: Build Frontend Components via AVCA/DIAS**
    *   [ ] Feed the generated blueprints into the full AVCA/DIAS pipeline.
    *   [ ] The system will use the appropriate personas (`frontend`, `tester`) to generate the React components, tests, and stories for its own user interface.
*   **[ ] Task 2.4: Assemble Application Pages**
    *   [ ] Manually or with AI assistance, assemble the generated components into the final application pages.

## 3. Phase 3: System Hardening & Fine-Tuning

**Objective**: To use the experience of the meta-development process to identify weaknesses, fix bugs, and fine-tune the AI's performance.

*   **[ ] Task 3.1: Analyze AI Performance**
    *   [ ] Meticulously review the quality of the code, blueprints, and components generated during Phase 2.
    *   [ ] Identify any areas where the AI struggled, made suboptimal decisions, or required significant manual correction.
*   **[ ] Task 3.2: Fine-Tune Personas & Prompts**
    *   [ ] Based on the analysis, update the prompts, instructions, and configurations for the SuperClaude personas to improve their performance.
*   **[ ] Task 3.3: Update Learning System**
    *   [ ] Feed the learnings from this process back into the DIAS `LearningSystem` to create a permanent record of successful and unsuccessful patterns.
