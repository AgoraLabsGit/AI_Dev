# Roadmap 7: Core Application UI & Navigation
**Primary Goal**: To design and build the primary user interface for the Vibe Lab application, including the main navigation, page layouts, and the initial core pages like the Roadmap and Task views.

---
_(This roadmap will be populated with detailed tasks for building out the main application UI after the core AI system from Roadmap 2 is implemented and hardened in Roadmap 4. The development will likely start with the "Roadmap" page to provide a visual interface for our planning documents.)_
