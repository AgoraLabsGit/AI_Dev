# Roadmap 2: Native AI Integration
**Primary Goal**: To build and integrate a native, persistent AI intelligence layer into Vibe Lab by implementing the SuperClaude framework as the core of the DIAS (Dynamic Intelligence & Adaptation System) and refactoring existing AVCA components to work with it.

---

## 1. Phase 1: System Assessment & Gap Analysis (Complete)

**Objective**: To perform a deep analysis of the existing codebase, compare it against our documentation, and create a detailed list of missing features and implementation gaps.

*   **[x] Task 1.1: Codebase Review for Core Systems**
*   **[x] Task 1.2: Identify Missing Systems & Features**

## 2. Phase 2: DIAS Core Implementation via SuperClaude Framework

**Objective**: To build the foundational DIAS services by creating service wrappers and TypeScript modules for the SuperClaude framework and TaskMaster tool.
**Testing**: This phase should be validated by the tasks in **Roadmap 3, Phase 1: Foundational Testing**.

*   **[ ] Task 2.1: Build DIAS Core Architecture**
    *   [ ] Build the **AI Orchestrator** powered by the SuperClaude Service Wrapper.
    *   [ ] Implement the **Specialized Intelligence Servers** (`Context7`, `Sequential`, `Magic`, `Playwright`) as MCP integrations coordinated by the SuperClaude service.
    *   [ ] Enhance the **Context Manager** with LRU cache, content compression, and a priority-based sliding window.
*   **[ ] Task 2.2: Implement DIAS Intelligence Modules**
    *   [ ] Build the **Conversational Interface** using the SuperClaude command and persona system for intent classification.
    *   [ ] Build the **Task Master System** by creating a service wrapper for the `task-master-ai` package.
    *   [ ] Implement remaining modules (`Feature Integration Engine`, `System Synchronizer`, etc.) leveraging the new SuperClaude services.
*   **[ ] Task 2.3: Implement DIAS System Memory & Adaptation**
    *   [ ] Build the **Multi-Layered Memory** system (in-memory, Redis, database) to persist SuperClaude sessions and learned data.
    *   [ ] Implement the **Adaptation Workflows** (e.g., Sequential Enhancement) using the SuperClaude Wave System.

## 3. Phase 3: AVCA & DIAS Integration

**Objective**: To refactor the existing, functional AVCA components to communicate with and be controlled by the new DIAS intelligence layer.
**Testing**: This phase should be validated by the integration tests in **Roadmap 3, Task 1.2** and the E2E tests in **Roadmap 3, Phase 2**.

*   **[ ] Task 3.1: Refactor AVCA Core Pipeline**
    *   [ ] Modify the `Blueprint Parser`, `Component Planner`, and `Code Generator` to emit DIAS events and listen for DIAS commands.
    *   [ ] Replace manual quality checks in the `Quality Assurance` stage with calls to the DIAS `Quality Intelligence` module, which will use SuperClaude's quality gates.
*   **[ ] Task 3.2: Integrate Staged Initialization**
    *   [ ] Update the `ServiceManager` to treat the new DIAS services as first-class citizens in the staged loading process.
*   **[ ] Task 3.3: Unify Data & Event Flow**
    *   [ ] Create a unified `PipelineData` object that is passed through both AVCA and DIAS workflows.
    *   [ ] Ensure the bidirectional event system is fully utilized between the existing and new components.
*   **[ ] Task 3.4: Implement Intelligent Caching**
    *   [ ] Build the intelligent caching strategy for AVCA, managed by DIAS's memory system.

## 4. Phase 4: Process Automation

**Objective**: To build the automated systems that streamline the development workflow.

*   **[ ] Task 4.1: Implement Automated Task Updating**
    *   [ ] Build the system for updating task statuses from Git commits, integrated with the new TaskMaster service.
