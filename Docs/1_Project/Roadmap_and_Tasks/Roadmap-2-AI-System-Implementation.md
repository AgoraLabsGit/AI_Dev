# Roadmap 2: Native AI Integration
**Primary Goal**: To integrate a native, persistent AI intelligence layer into Vibe Lab by leveraging the existing **SuperClaude** framework and its `task-master` CLI as the core of the DIAS (Dynamic Intelligence & Adaptation System), and refactoring existing AVCA components to work with it.

---

## Technical Note: `tsconfig.json` Configuration Failure (August 2025)

**Root Cause of Systemic Build Failure:** A critical misconfiguration in `vibe-lab-product/tsconfig.json` was the source of over 1,000 TypeScript errors, leading to a complete inability to build or run the project. The file was generated incorrectly, lacking essential properties for module resolution.

**Problem:** The `paths` alias (`@/*`) was defined without a corresponding `"baseUrl": "."`. This single omission broke every aliased import across the entire project, causing a cascade of "Module not found" errors.

**Resolution:**
1.  Added `"baseUrl": "."` to `compilerOptions` to enable path aliasing.
2.  Scoped the `include` array to `["next-env.d.ts", "src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", ".next/types/**/*.ts"]` to prevent the compiler from scanning irrelevant directories.

**Impact:** This failure wasted significant time on debugging what appeared to be code-level issues but were in fact environmental. This note serves as a permanent record. If widespread "Module not found" errors reappear, **VERIFY THIS FILE FIRST.**

## 2. Phase 2: DIAS Core Integration with SuperClaude & TaskMaster

**Objective**: To integrate the foundational DIAS services by creating TypeScript service wrappers that programmatically interact with the external `task-master` CLI and its underlying SuperClaude toolset.
**Testing**: This phase should be validated by the tasks in **Roadmap 3, Phase 1 & 2**.

*   **[âœ…] Task 2.1: Integrate DIAS Core Architecture** - **COMPLETED (August 2025)**
    *   [âœ…] Create the **AI Orchestrator Service**, a TypeScript wrapper around the `task-master` CLI.
        *   **âœ… Implemented**: Intelligent model selection (Haiku for routing, Sonnet for dev, Opus for audit)
        *   **âœ… Implemented**: Resilience patterns (Token Bucket rate limiting, Circuit Breaker with 5-failure threshold)
        *   **âœ… File**: `/src/lib/dias/services/ai-orchestrator/ai-orchestrator-service.ts`
    *   [âœ…] Implement TypeScript interfaces for the **Specialized Intelligence Servers** (`Context7`, `Sequential`, `Magic`, `Playwright`) which are invoked via the `task-master` CLI.
        *   **âœ… Implemented**: Complete interface definitions and factory patterns
        *   **âœ… File**: `/src/lib/dias/services/mcp-servers/mcp-interfaces.ts`
        *   **âœ… Active**: Context7 server operational, Sequential/Magic/Playwright ready for next phase
    *   [âœ…] Create a **Context Manager Service** that prepares data for the CLI and implements LRU caching.
        *   **âœ… Implemented**: LRU caching with TTL support and intelligent compression
        *   **âœ… Implemented**: New summarization approach using LLM-based compression (replacing failed algorithm)
        *   **âœ… File**: `/src/lib/dias/services/context-manager/context-manager-service.ts`
*   **[ ] Task 2.2: Implement DIAS Intelligence Modules**
    *   _(...content unchanged...)_
*   **[ ] Task 2.3: Implement DIAS System Memory & Adaptation**

## ðŸŽ¯ **AUGUST 2025 ENHANCEMENT UPDATE**

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **CORE INTEGRATION COMPLETED**  
**Next Phase**: Roadmap 8 - AI System Integration Enhancement

### **Major Achievements (August 2025)**

Following the comprehensive intelligence audit, significant enhancements have been successfully implemented:

#### **âœ… SuperClaude Framework Integration**
- **PersonaMapper Service**: Seamless bridge between AVCA 3-role system and DIAS 11-persona system
- **Enhanced AI Client**: SuperClaude integration with graceful fallback to existing implementation
- **Missing API Endpoints**: `/plan`, `/review`, `/help` endpoints now operational
- **Context7 MCP Server**: Documentation lookup and pattern recognition active

#### **âœ… Zero Breaking Changes Achieved**
- All existing AVCA functionality preserved completely
- Existing AI client maintains full backward compatibility
- Frontend components work unchanged with optional enhancements
- Database schema extended without migration requirements

#### **âœ… Production-Ready Integration**
- Feature flag controlled rollout (`useSuperClaude: true/false`)
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
- Token optimization and cost management
- Performance monitoring and health checks

### **Files Implemented**
