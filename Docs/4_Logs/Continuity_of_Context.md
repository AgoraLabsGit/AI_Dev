### **Last Updated: July 30, 2024**

#### **Current Goal**
The primary objective is to begin the implementation of the native AI intelligence layer, as outlined in `Roadmap-2-AI-System-Implementation.md`.

#### **Current Status**

*   **Final Strategic Alignment Complete**: The project's strategy is fully aligned and documented. We have a clear, sequential 5-part roadmap that covers initial implementation, testing, meta-development, and future V2.0 capabilities.
*   **Documentation Pristine**: All core technical documents (`AI_System_Overview.md`, `System_Architecture.md`) and planning documents (`Roadmap-2`, `Tasks-2`, etc.) have been updated to reflect the central role of the "SuperClaude" persona framework. All redundant and outdated files have been cleaned up.
*   **Ready for Implementation**: The `task-master-ai` package is initialized, the foundational directory structure is created, and all planning is complete.

#### **Next Steps**

We are ready to begin development. The immediate next steps are to execute the tasks outlined in **`Roadmap-2, Phase 2`** and detailed in **`Tasks-2-AI-System-Implementation.md`**, starting with:

1.  **Build the AI Orchestrator** (Task 2.1.1).
2.  **Implement the basic SuperClaude service wrapper**.
3.  **Begin porting the SuperClaude configurations** into TypeScript modules.
