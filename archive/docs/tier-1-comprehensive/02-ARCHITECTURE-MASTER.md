# 02 - Architecture Master
**System Design and Technical Decisions**
<!-- AI Genesis Guide: For migrations, analyze the legacy project's package.json and framework files. For new projects, ask the user about their preferred stack. -->

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture
- [AI: Ask the user to describe the desired architecture (e.g., Monolith, Microservices). Propose a standard Jamstack/Serverless model if they are unsure.]

## 2. Technology Stack Rationale
- **Frontend**: [AI: Ask/confirm the frontend framework (e.g., Next.js) and why it was chosen.]
- **Backend**: [AI: Ask/confirm the backend approach (e.g., Serverless Functions).]
- **Database**: [AI: Ask/confirm the database (e.g., PostgreSQL).]

## 3. Data Flow
- [AI: Inform the user that you will document the primary data flow patterns here as they are built.]

## 4. Key Architectural Patterns
- [AI: Propose a set of standard patterns (e.g., Repository Pattern for data access) and ask for confirmation.]
