# Vibe Lab - Future Roadmap & Ideas

This document outlines the long-term vision, potential features, and architectural enhancements for the Vibe Lab platform. It serves as a backlog of ideas to be prioritized after the immediate roadmap is complete.

## 1. Core Product Evolution

**Goal**: Expand the platform's core capabilities beyond initial project generation.

*   **Targeted Enhancement Path**:
    *   **Description**: A new onboarding flow focused on importing and improving existing codebases, designed for freelancers and consultants.
    *   **Key Features**:
        *   Codebase Analyst Agent: AI to map dependencies, visualize architecture, and assess technical debt.
        *   Legacy Modernizer Agent: AI to perform safe dependency upgrades and framework migrations.
        *   Enhanced "Plan" page with architecture diagrams and risk assessment tools.
*   **Desktop Application**:
    *   **Description**: A long-term goal to migrate the web application into a native desktop experience using Electron.
    *   **Benefits**: Deeper OS integration, offline capabilities, and enhanced performance.

## 2. Advanced UI/UX & Component System

**Goal**: Evolve the user interface into a professional-grade developer experience.

*   **Magic MCP Integration**:
    *   **Description**: Leverage the Magic MCP component library for advanced data visualization and a more sophisticated UI.
    *   **Key Features**:
        *   Interactive dependency graphs and task complexity heatmaps.
        *   Upgraded command palette with multi-tab support (Chat, Commands, Search).
        *   Integrated Monaco Editor for a first-class code editing experience.
*   **"224 Component" System**:
    *   **Description**: A detailed, phased plan to build out a comprehensive library of 224 production-ready UI components.
    *   **Note**: This is a large, detailed plan that can be implemented in parallel with backend development. The full plan is archived but can be referenced for its component list.

## 3. Future Architectural Enhancements

**Goal**: Explore and potentially integrate new technologies to enhance the platform.

*   **Gemini Model Integration**:
    *   **Description**: Investigate using a Gemini model alongside our Claude-based agents.
    *   **Rationale**: Gemini's potentially larger context window could be valuable for analyzing very large codebases or complex documentation stores. This would be explored as a specialized tool, not a replacement for the core three-agent system.
*   **One-Click Deployment**:
    *   **Description**: Integrate with the Vercel API to provide seamless, one-click deployment of generated applications.
    *   **Rationale**: This completes the "Design → Build → Iterate" loop by allowing users to instantly deploy and test their applications in a live environment.
*   **Automated System Optimization**:
    *   **Description**: Enhance the DIAS to not only suggest but also automatically implement optimizations to the Vibe Lab system itself.

## 4. New Feature Ideas

**Goal**: A parking lot for new feature ideas to be considered in the future.

*   **"Quick Add" Universal Capture**: A system to quickly capture notes or ideas that the AI automatically processes and files in the correct location (e.g., as a task, a roadmap item, or a learning).
*   **Enhanced Error Logging**: Integrate a more robust, cross-platform error logging system that feeds directly into the `Learning_Log.md`.
