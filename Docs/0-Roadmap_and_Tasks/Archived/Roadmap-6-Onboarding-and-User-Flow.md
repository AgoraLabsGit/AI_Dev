# Roadmap 6: Onboarding & User Flow
**Primary Goal**: To design and build the complete, user-facing onboarding experience for Vibe Lab. This includes the sign-in/authentication flow and the initial project creation and overview pages.

_(This roadmap will be populated with detailed tasks for building out the user onboarding workflow after the core AI system from Roadmap 2 is implemented and hardened in Roadmap 4.)_
