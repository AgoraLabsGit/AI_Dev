## 2. User Stories (MVP)

### **User Account Management & Authentication**
- **As a** user, **I want to** be able to create an account and log in **so that** I can manage my projects securely.
- **As a** user, **I want to** be able to connect my GitHub account **so that** Vibe Lab can create repositories on my behalf.

### **Project Dashboard & Management**
- **As a** user, **I want to** see all of my projects on a central dashboard **so that** I can easily track my work.
- **As a** user, **I want to** be able to create a new project from the dashboard **so that** I can start the blueprinting process.

### **Guided Blueprinting Workflow**
- **As a** user, **I want to** be guided through a structured process of creating blueprint documents **so that** I can establish a strong architectural foundation.
- **As a** user, **I want to** interact with an AI via a chat interface to fill out the blueprint documents **so that** the process is collaborative and intuitive.

### **Component Roadmap Generation**
- **As a** user, **I want** the AI to analyze my completed blueprints and generate a roadmap of core components to build **so that** I have a clear plan for creating my system's "Lego blocks."

### **Enhanced Task Management (Task Master)**
- **As a** user, **I want** the Task Master to automatically generate a comprehensive task analysis from my approved roadmap **so that** I have detailed complexity scores, dependency mapping, resource allocation recommendations, and risk assessment displayed through Magic-enhanced data visualization components for efficient project execution with dual-Claude coordination.

### **Foundational Documentation Synthesis**
- **As a** user, **I want to** trigger a `GENERATE FOUNDATION` command **so that** the AI can synthesize my blueprints and roadmap into a set of comprehensive, code-backed TIER-1 documents.

### **Push-to-GitHub Integration**
- **As a** user, **I want** the application to push the generated foundation, roadmap, and scaffolded code to a new GitHub repository **so that** I can immediately clone it and begin local development.

## 3. Enhanced Platform User Stories **(NEW)**

### **AI Tier Strategy (Phased Implementation)**
- **As a** basic tier user, **I want** to use dual-Claude instances (Developer + Auditor) **so that** I have independent code generation and review with complete context isolation.
- **As a** pro tier user, **I want** access to hybrid AI architecture (Claude + Gemini) when available **so that** I can handle enterprise-scale projects with larger context requirements.
- **As a** platform user, **I want** the system to automatically recommend the appropriate AI tier based on my project complexity **so that** I get optimal performance for my specific needs.

### **Magic UI Framework Integration**
- **As a** developer, **I want** access to Magic MCP's AI-powered component generation **so that** I can create professional-grade UI components using natural language descriptions.
- **As a** user, **I want** interactive data visualization components from Magic's library **so that** I can understand complex project information through charts, graphs, and dashboards.
- **As a** developer, **I want** Magic components to automatically integrate with Vibe Lab's design system **so that** all generated components maintain consistent styling and behavior.
- **As a** power user, **I want** advanced developer tool interfaces powered by Magic **so that** I have Monaco Editor integration, Git visualizers, and professional command interfaces.

### **Targeted Enhancement Workflows**
- **As a** freelance developer, **I want** a 4th onboarding option called "Targeted Enhancement" **so that** I can improve specific parts of existing projects rather than starting from scratch.
- **As a** consultant, **I want** to select the type of enhancement I need (Bug Fix, Feature Addition, Refactoring, etc.) **so that** the platform can provide specialized workflows for my specific use case.

### **Existing Codebase Analysis & Visualization**
- **As a** developer, **I want** to import an existing codebase via GitHub or file upload **so that** I can get Claude-powered analysis of the current architecture and technical debt.
- **As a** freelancer, **I want** to see a comprehensive codebase overview with dependency graphs, architecture diagrams, and code quality metrics **so that** I can quickly understand unfamiliar systems.
- **As a** consultant, **I want** automated security vulnerability scanning and performance bottleneck identification **so that** I can provide professional assessment to clients.

### **Legacy Modernization & Safe Upgrades**
- **As a** developer, **I want** the Claude Legacy Modernizer agent to analyze safe dependency upgrade pathways **so that** I can modernize projects without breaking existing functionality.
- **As a** freelancer, **I want** incremental migration strategies with rollback capabilities **so that** I can safely upgrade frameworks and patterns for clients.
- **As a** consultant, **I want** compatibility validation and performance regression monitoring **so that** I can guarantee successful modernization outcomes.

### **Freelancer Professional Workflows**
- **As a** freelancer, **I want** rapid codebase assessment (15-minute analysis) **so that** I can quickly scope client projects and provide accurate estimates.
- **As a** consultant, **I want** client-ready reports with professional documentation **so that** I can deliver comprehensive assessments that justify my recommendations.
- **As a** freelancer, **I want** incremental delivery workflows with client approval gates **so that** I can manage project scope and maintain client confidence throughout enhancements.

### **Client-Ready Reports & Documentation**
- **As a** freelancer, **I want** automated generation of enhancement plans with time and cost estimates **so that** I can provide professional proposals to clients.
- **As a** consultant, **I want** comprehensive change documentation and migration guides **so that** I can deliver complete handoff packages to clients.
- **As a** freelancer, **I want** pull request generation with detailed change explanations **so that** clients can understand exactly what was modified and why.
