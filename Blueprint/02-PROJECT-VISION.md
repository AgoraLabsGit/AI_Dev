# Phase 0: Blueprint - Project Vision

**Last Updated**: 2024-07-23

## 1. The Core Problem
> What is the single, most important problem we are trying to solve? Who are we solving it for?

Developers and engineering teams spend an inordinate amount of time on the repetitive, error-prone, and non-creative tasks of setting up new projects. They struggle with architectural decisions, establishing code standards, and creating foundational documentation, leading to inconsistent codebases, technical debt, and slower time-to-market.

## 2. The Solution
> In one or two sentences, how does this project solve that problem?

Vibe Lab is a commercial SaaS platform that acts as an AI co-pilot, guiding developers through a structured, best-practice development lifecycle. It transforms high-level concepts into a well-architected, production-ready, and fully-documented codebase, allowing teams to build better software, faster.

## 3. Key Goals & Success Metrics
> What are the primary objectives? How will we know if we have succeeded?

1.  **Goal**: Validate the core MVP workflow.
    *   **Metric**: Successfully guide 50 beta users through the full `Blueprint` -> `Component Roadmap` -> `GENERATE FOUNDATION` -> `Push-to-GitHub` flow.
2.  **Goal**: Deliver a high-quality, professional developer experience.
    *   **Metric**: Achieve a user satisfaction score of 8/10 or higher from our beta users.
3.  **Goal**: Build a foundation for the post-MVP local agent.
    *   **Metric**: The architecture of the MVP is designed in a way that clearly supports the future integration of the real-time local agent.

## 4. Target Audience
> Describe the ideal user for this product in detail.

*   **Primary User Group A (Coders)**: Professional software engineers, team leads, and freelance developers who want to accelerate the creation of well-architected applications and automate the tedious parts of project setup.
*   **Primary User Group B (Creators)**: Non-developers, including entrepreneurs, product managers, designers, and students, who want to translate their ideas into functional, production-ready code without writing it themselves. Vibe Lab will be their technical co-founder.

## 5. Non-Goals (for the MVP)
> What are we explicitly choosing *not* to do? This helps define the scope.

*   We will **not** build the real-time local agent (Model B). The MVP will use the "Push-to-GitHub" model (Model A), and the onboarding flow will reflect this.
*   We will **not** build the `Component Lab`, `Live Preview`, or `Directory` pages.
*   We will **not** implement complex, real-time "Vibe Coding" features. The initial development will be done locally by the user after cloning the generated repo.
