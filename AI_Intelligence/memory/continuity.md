## Current Status

The project blueprinting and strategic planning phase is **100% complete, committed, and aligned**. Through a series of audits and iterative refinements, we have established a robust, production-ready architectural plan for the Vibe Lab SaaS platform.

The final, approved blueprint details:
- A UI/UX vision inspired by **Linear**.
- A sophisticated **multi-agent AI architecture** (Gemini/Developer, Claude/Auditor).
- A strict, four-phase **code generation pipeline** (Blueprint -> Roadmap -> Foundation -> Scaffold).
- A well-defined project structure that separates concerns (`Blueprints`, `Documentation`, `Intelligence`, `New Project`).

All blueprint documents have been organized with a clean, sequential naming convention. The `Project_Roadmap.md` and the detailed `Documentation/tasks.md` are in place to guide development. The project is now ready to move into the implementation phase.

## Next Actions

The immediate next step is to begin **Phase 1: Core Foundation & Authentication** as defined in the project roadmap and task list.

1.  **Execute Task P1.1 (Project Scaffolding)**: Initialize a new Next.js project in the `New Project/` directory, configured with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
2.  **Continue with Wave 1**: Proceed with the tasks outlined in the "Wave 1: Foundation Setup" section of `Documentation/tasks.md`.
