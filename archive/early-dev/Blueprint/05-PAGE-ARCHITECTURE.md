# 02 - Page Architecture
**Application Structure, User Flow, and Component Mapping**
<!-- AI Genesis Guide: Use this document to define the high-level page structure of the application. Map out each page, its purpose, and the core components it will require. -->

## 1. High-Level User Flow (Complete Vision)
- `Unauthenticated User` -> `Login Page` -> `Onboarding Wizard` (First time only)
- `Authenticated User` -> `Dashboard` -> `Select or Create Project` -> `Workspace`
- **Workspace Navigation**: Following the **Plan / Build / Test / Visualize** framework via Linear-inspired three-column layout.
    - `Plan` (Blueprint creation and roadmap generation)
    - `Build` (Task management and development)
    - `Test` (Quality assurance and validation)
    - `Visualize` (Project output and review)
- **Command Palette**: Primary interaction via `Cmd+K` Vibe Chat accessible from any page

---

## 2. Core Application Layout
Magic-enhanced Linear-inspired three-column layout optimized for keyboard-driven productivity with professional-grade UI components.

- **`<AppLayout />`** (Magic-Enhanced Three-Column Layout)
    - **Column 1 - Navigation (`<MainNavigation />`)**: Fixed sidebar with Magic navigation components, project switching, and status indicators
    - **Column 2 - Content (`<MainContent />`)**: Primary content area with Magic data visualization, interactive components, and Monaco Editor integration
    - **Column 3 - Context (`<ContextualPanel />`)**: Magic-enhanced details panel with AI agent status, real-time updates, and contextual actions
    - **`<CommandPalette />`**: Magic multi-tab interface accessible via `Cmd+K` - Chat, Commands, Search, Navigation tabs with fuzzy search and AI coordination

## 2.1. Magic MCP Component Integration Strategy

Magic MCP provides production-ready UI components through AI-powered generation and the 21st.dev component library. This integration elevates Vibe Lab from basic UI to professional-grade developer tool experience.

### Core Magic Integration Principles
- **Production-Ready Components**: Copy-paste components with full customization, no vendor lock-in
- **AI-Powered Generation**: Natural language descriptions generate professional UI components
- **21st.dev Library**: Access to curated, tested component patterns from the community
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatic styling integration with Vibe Lab design system

### Magic Component Categories for Vibe Lab
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts, graphs, dependency visualizers, architecture diagrams
- **Developer Tools**: Monaco Editor integration, file browsers, Git visualizers, terminal interfaces
- **AI Coordination**: Agent status displays, context visualization, real-time collaboration indicators
- **Command Interfaces**: Advanced command palette, multi-tab interfaces, keyboard shortcut overlays
- **Project Management**: Task boards, progress tracking, resource allocation dashboards

### Magic Integration Workflow
1. **Component Discovery**: Use Magic MCP to search 21st.dev library for relevant patterns
2. **AI Generation**: Describe component requirements in natural language
3. **Customization**: Apply Vibe Lab design system and specific functionality requirements
4. **Integration**: Copy-paste generated component with full TypeScript support
5. **Enhancement**: Add Vibe Lab-specific features and AI integration capabilities
