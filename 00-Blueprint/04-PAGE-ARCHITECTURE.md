# 02 - Page Architecture
**Application Structure, User Flow, and Component Mapping**
<!-- AI Genesis Guide: Use this document to define the high-level page structure of the application. Map out each page, its purpose, and the core components it will require. -->

---

## 1. High-Level User Flow (Complete Vision)
- `Unauthenticated User` -> `Login Page` -> `Onboarding Wizard` (First time only)
- `Authenticated User` -> `Dashboard` -> `Select or Create Project` -> `Workspace`
- **Workspace Navigation**: Following the **Plan / Build / Test / Visualize** framework via Linear-inspired three-column layout.
    - `Plan` (Blueprint creation and roadmap generation)
    - `Build` (Task management and development)
    - `Test` (Quality assurance and validation)
    - `Visualize` (Project output and review)
- **Command Palette**: Primary interaction via `Cmd+K` Vibe Chat accessible from any page

---

## 2. Core Application Layout
Linear-inspired three-column layout optimized for keyboard-driven productivity.

- **`<AppLayout />`** (Three-Column Layout)
    - **Column 1 - Navigation (`<MainNavigation />`)**: Fixed sidebar with links to `Dashboard`, `Plan`, `Build`, `Test`, `Visualize`
    - **Column 2 - Content (`<MainContent />`)**: Primary content area showing lists, documents, tasks
    - **Column 3 - Context (`<ContextualPanel />`)**: Details panel or embedded Command Palette
    - **`<CommandPalette />`**: Vibe Chat accessible via `Cmd+K` from anywhere, supports multi-agent conversations

## 3. Page Definitions

### 3.1. Onboarding Wizard **(MVP - Step 1)**
- **Route**: `/welcome`
- **Purpose**: A one-time setup wizard for new users.
- **Steps**:
    - 1. Welcome message and brief tour of the Vibe Lab concept.
    - 2. Connect GitHub account (critical for MVP's "Push-to-GitHub" feature).
    - 3. Confirmation and redirection to the Dashboard.
    - *Note*: The Local Agent setup mentioned in `UX_FLOW.md` is a Post-MVP feature and will not be included here initially.

### 3.2. Login Page **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/login`
- **Purpose**: Authenticate the user, primarily via GitHub OAuth.

### 3.3. Dashboard Page **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/dashboard`
- **Purpose**: User's home base to see all their projects and create new ones. It also serves as the entry point for the New Project Wizard.

### 3.4. New Project Wizard **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/new` (Likely presented as a modal over the dashboard)
- **Purpose**: To guide the user through creating a new project.
- **Steps (MVP focus)**:
    - 1. **"How would you like to start?"**
        - **Option 1: From Scratch** (User provides a project name).
        - **Option 2: From a GitHub Repository** (User provides a URL to an existing repository).
    - 2. Confirmation, project creation, and redirection to the new project's `Plan` page.

### 3.5. Plan Page **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/project/{projectId}/plan`
- **Purpose**: **PLAN phase** - Blueprint creation and roadmap generation. Interactive editor for AI-guided blueprint documents, with automatic roadmap generation upon completion.
- **Features**: Blueprint editor, roadmap generation, Task Master integration

### 3.6. Build Page **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/project/{projectId}/build`
- **Purpose**: **BUILD phase** - Task management and development tracking. Displays detailed task lists generated by Task Master (SuperClaude) from the approved roadmap.
- **Features**: Task lists, progress tracking, development status

### 3.7. Test Page **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/project/{projectId}/test`
- **Purpose**: **TEST phase** - Quality assurance and validation. Foundation review and code quality assessment using multi-agent system.
- **Features**: Foundation review, audit results from Claude, quality gates

### 3.8. Visualize Page **(MVP)**
- **Route**: `/project/{projectId}/visualize`
- **Purpose**: **VISUALIZE phase** - Project output and final review. View generated code, documentation, and push to GitHub.
- **Features**: Code preview, documentation review, GitHub integration, Development Log display

### 3.9. Directory Page **(Post-MVP)**
- **Route**: `/project/{projectId}/directory`
- **Purpose**: File structure exploration utility.
- **Sub-Views / Components**:
    - **`<FocusView />`**: Intelligently displays only files relevant to current task
    - **`<FullTreeView />`**: Traditional file explorer

### 3.10. Component Lab **(Post-MVP)**
- **Route**: `/project/{projectId}/components`
- **Purpose**: Storybook-like environment for viewing individual UI components in isolation.
