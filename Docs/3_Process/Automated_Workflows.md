# AI Collaboration System & Automated Workflows

This document defines the comprehensive collaboration framework between the **Developer AI** and the **Auditor AI**, who work together in a systematic, automated fashion to deliver high-quality software projects.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy & Roles

*   **Developer AI**: Executes development, implements features, and writes code.
*   **Auditor AI**: Manages the project, reviews code, and ensures quality and alignment with goals.
*   **Automated Handoffs**: Seamless task transitions with minimal human intervention.
*   **Systematic Reviews**: Structured audit and validation cycles.

## 2. Collaboration Workflows

### Daily Development Cycle

1.  **Morning Sync (Automated)**: The Auditor AI reviews overnight progress, generates daily priorities, and assigns tasks to the Developer AI.
2.  **Development Phase (Continuous)**: The Developer AI implements features and commits code with descriptive messages and task IDs. The Task Master system automatically updates task statuses.
3.  **Review Cycle (Triggered)**: When a feature is complete, the Auditor AI performs an automated code review, provides structured feedback, and approves the changes or requests revisions.
4.  **Evening Wrap-up (Automated)**: The Auditor AI generates a daily progress report, identifies the next day's priorities, and sends a summary to human stakeholders if configured.

### Weekly Planning Cycle

*   **Monday (Sprint Planning)**: The Auditor AI analyzes the previous week's progress, adjusts priorities, and generates the task assignments for the upcoming week.
*   **Wednesday (Mid-Sprint Review)**: The Auditor AI assesses progress against weekly goals and adjusts scope if necessary.
*   **Friday (Sprint Retrospective)**: The Auditor AI analyzes the week's achievements, updates the project roadmap, and generates performance metrics.

## 3. Code Review Framework

The Auditor AI uses a weighted, automated review process to ensure quality.

| Category | Weight | Key Factors |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Code Quality** | 30% | Readability, maintainability, standards compliance |
| **Security** | 25% | Auth checks, data validation, access control |
| **Performance** | 20% | Bundle size, runtime performance, caching |
| **Architecture** | 15% | Pattern consistency, separation of concerns |
| **Testing** | 10% | Coverage, quality, regression prevention |

*   **Auto-Approve Threshold**: > 8.5 / 10
*   **Requires Changes Threshold**: < 6.0 / 10
*   **Escalate to Human Threshold**: < 4.0 / 10

## 4. Implementation Architecture

### Communication & Context
*   **AI-to-AI Protocol**: The agents communicate using a structured messaging protocol with types like `task_assignment`, `code_review`, and `status_update`.
*   **Shared Context**: A shared context store maintains information about the current sprint, active tasks, recent commits, and project health metrics.

### Quality Gates & Escalation
*   **Automated Quality Gates**: The system enforces quality at multiple stages: pre-commit, post-commit, pre-merge, and pre-deploy.
*   **Escalation Protocols**: There are automated rules for escalating issues. For example, a quality gate failure might be escalated to the Auditor AI, while a task that is blocked for more than 24 hours is escalated to a human.

## 5. Success Vision

When fully implemented, this collaboration system will enable:

*   **Autonomous Development**: Features implemented and deployed with minimal human intervention.
*   **Predictable Quality**: Consistent code quality and security standards maintained automatically.
*   **Accelerated Delivery**: A 2-3x improvement in feature delivery velocity.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Human developers can focus on high-level strategy and complex problems.
*   **Continuous Learning**: The system improves over time through experience and feedback.

The ultimate goal is a self-managing development process that delivers high-quality software faster and more reliably than traditional human-only approaches, while maintaining the creativity and strategic thinking that humans provide.
