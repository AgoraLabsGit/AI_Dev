### **Date**: 2024-07-26
### **Focus Area**: Blueprinting & Audit Enhancements

#### Log:
Completed a comprehensive, multi-stage blueprinting process. The initial blueprint was found to be misaligned with the core project vision and was subsequently deleted. A second, more accurate blueprint was created based on a thorough review of the `Concept-&-Inspiration` documents. This was followed by three rounds of audits which resulted in significant enhancements.

The final, approved blueprint now details a sophisticated SaaS platform with a multi-agent AI architecture (Gemini for development, Claude for auditing), a decoupled frontend/backend, and a clear MVP strategy. All critical architectural, security, and workflow gaps identified during the audits have been addressed. The project is now production-ready for MVP development.
