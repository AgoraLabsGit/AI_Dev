## 1. AI Onboarding Protocol

Welcome, System Architect. Your first task is to build a comprehensive understanding of the project you are about to create.

**Your Primary Directive**: Thoroughly read, analyze, and synthesize all documents contained within the `../Concept-&-Inspiration/` directory.

This folder contains the foundational product vision, methodology, and high-level concepts. Your understanding of these documents will inform every subsequent step of the blueprinting process.

## 2. Next Steps

Once you have a complete understanding of the source material, you will initiate the formal blueprinting process, starting with `00-PROJECT-CONFIG-SETUP.md`. Your goal is to translate the ideas from the `Concept & Inspiration` folder into the structured, actionable documents of the Vibe Lab blueprint.
