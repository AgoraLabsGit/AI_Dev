# Vibe Lab Archive

This archive contains historical development artifacts and documentation from the early stages of Vibe Lab development. The content has been organized into three main categories for easy reference.

## Directory Structure

### `/concepts`
Early design documents and planning materials:
- Original concept documents and inspiration
- UX design plans
- System architecture proposals
- Review documents and audits
- Early iteration plans

### `/docs`
Technical documentation and implementation patterns:
- Tier 1: Comprehensive master documents
- Tier 2: Quick reference guides
- Tier 3: Implementation patterns
- Project roadmaps and task lists
- Code of conduct and guidelines

### `/early-dev`
Initial implementation attempts and AI integration:
- AI Intelligence framework
- Original Blueprint documents
- Development notes
- Early automation attempts

## Note on AVCA-DIAS Documentation
The authoritative AVCA-DIAS documentation has been moved to `/vibe-lab-system/docs/` as it represents the current source of truth for the system implementation.

## Archive Purpose
This archive serves as a historical reference to understand:
1. The evolution of Vibe Lab's design
2. Early architectural decisions
3. Development process improvements
4. Learning from initial implementations

While this content is preserved for reference, all active development should follow the current documentation in `vibe-lab-system/docs/` and implement within `vibe-lab-product/`.
