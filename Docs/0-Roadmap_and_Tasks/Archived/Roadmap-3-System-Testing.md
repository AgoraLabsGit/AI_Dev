## 1. Phase 1: Foundational Testing
_(...content unchanged...)_

---

## 2. Phase 2: E2E & Intelligence Testing

**Objective**: To perform end-to-end testing of AI-driven workflows and validate the "intelligence" of the SuperClaude framework against established baselines.

*   **[ ] Task 2.1: Create E2E Tests for AI-Driven Workflows**
    *   _(...content unchanged...)_
*   **[ ] Task 2.2: Develop Intelligence Validation Tests**
    *   _(...content unchanged...)_
*   **[ ] Task 2.3: Perform Load Testing**
    *   **Insight from Log**: The system has not been tested under sustained, high-concurrency usage.
    *   [ ] Develop and execute load tests to validate the performance and resilience of the rate limiters, retry handlers, and concurrent request managers.
*   **[ ] Task 2.4: Validate Performance & Cost Baselines**
    *   **Actionable Insight**: The historical reports provide concrete performance and cost targets to meet or exceed.
    *   [ ] Create benchmark tests to validate that new DIAS services operate within the **0-4ms response time** established by the original AVCA components.
    *   [ ] Create validation tests to confirm that the AI Orchestrator's cost-per-transaction aligns with the optimized baselines from the Phase 0 report.
