# AVCA & DIAS Precursor Roadmap
## System Preparation for Multi-Path Onboarding Flow

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the necessary updates to AVCA (Automated Vibe Component Architecture) and DIAS (Dynamic Intelligence & Adaptation System) to support the multi-path onboarding flow while maintaining strict compliance with our Tailwind-only architecture. The system will support four entry points: fresh start, GitHub import, code migration, and documentation import.

## Current System Analysis

### AVCA Current State
```typescript
// lib/avca/services/ai-client.ts
interface AIClient {
  generateCode: (prompt: string, context: Context) => Promise<string>;
  reviewCode: (code: string, context: Context) => Promise<Review>;
  classifyIntent: (input: string) => Promise<Intent>;
}
```

### DIAS Current State
```typescript
// lib/dias/index.ts
interface DIAS {
  enableAuditTrail?: boolean;
  enableLearning?: boolean;
  enableSuggestions?: boolean;
}
```
