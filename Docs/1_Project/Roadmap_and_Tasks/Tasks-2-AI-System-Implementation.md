## Phase 3: AVCA & DIAS Integration
**Objective**: To refactor the existing, functional AVCA components to communicate with and be controlled by the new DIAS intelligence layer.

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Dependencies | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3.1.1 | Refactor AVCA Core Pipeline | Modify pipeline stages to emit/listen for DIAS events | Phase 2 | 7/10 |
| 3.1.2 | Integrate Quality Intelligence | Replace manual checks with calls to DIAS Quality module | 3.1.1 | 6/10 |
| 3.2.1 | Integrate Staged Initialization | Add new DIAS services to `ServiceManager` | Phase 2 | 5/10 |
| 3.3.1 | Unify Data & Event Flow | Create a unified `PipelineData` object | 3.1.1 | 6/10 |
| 3.4.1 | Implement Intelligent Caching | Build caching strategy for AVCA, managed by DIAS | 2.3.1 | 7/10 |

## Phase 4: Process Automation
**Objective**: To build the automated systems that streamline the development workflow.

| Task ID | Task Name | Description | Dependencies | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4.1.1 | Git Commit Parser | Extract task info from Git commit messages | None | 5/10 |
| 4.1.2 | Task Status Updater | Auto-update task status via TaskMaster service | 2.2.2, 4.1.1 | 6/10 |
