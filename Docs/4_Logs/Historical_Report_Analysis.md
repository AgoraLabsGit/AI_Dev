# Discovery Analysis of Archived Build Reports

**Purpose**: This document synthesizes the key findings and actionable insights from the 10 recovered historical build reports. Its goal is to inform the implementation strategy for Roadmap 2 and the testing strategy for Roadmap 3.

## 1. Key Discovery: Extreme Development Velocity

**Finding**: The most consistent theme across all reports is the **extreme development efficiency**, ranging from **3x to 10x faster** than estimated. A 16-hour task (COMP-001) was completed in 4.25 hours. A 60-hour phase was completed in 6 hours.

**Insight for Roadmap 2**:
*   The current time estimates in our detailed task list (`Tasks-2...md`) may be overly conservative. We should be prepared to accelerate our timeline if this velocity continues.
*   This proves that the core architectural pattern of breaking work into small, well-defined, independently testable stages is highly effective and should be strictly maintained.

## 2. Performance & Cost Baselines

**Finding**: The reports provide concrete performance and cost baselines for the existing AVCA/DIAS components.
*   **Performance**: Pipeline stages consistently operate in the **0-4ms range**.
*   **Cost**: The initial AI client implementation provided a detailed cost-per-request breakdown (e.g., Router: ~$0.0003, Developer: ~$0.03). The Phase 0 report established a hard requirement that **cost is a critical feature** to be optimized.

**Insight for Roadmap 2 & 3**:
*   **Roadmap 2**: The new DIAS services we build *must* be benchmarked against these existing performance standards. Any new service that is significantly slower needs to be justified or optimized.
*   **Roadmap 3**: Our testing plan *must* include performance benchmark tests that validate these sub-5ms response times. It must also include cost-per-transaction validation to ensure the AI Orchestrator's model selection is effective.

## 3. Architectural Decisions to Uphold

**Finding**: The reports document several critical, low-level architectural decisions that are not fully detailed in the high-level documents.
*   **Rate Limiting**: Uses a **Token Bucket** algorithm for flexibility, with conservative defaults and a 1.5x burst allowance.
*   **Resilience**: Implements a **Circuit Breaker** pattern that opens after 5 consecutive failures and auto-recovers after 60 seconds.
*   **AI Model Selection**: A role-based model selection strategy (Haiku for routing, Sonnet for development, Opus for auditing) was a key outcome of the Phase 0 cost crisis.

**Insight for Roadmap 2**:
*   These specific, proven configurations should be the **starting point** for our new DIAS services. We should inherit and expand upon this resilience architecture, not reinvent it.
*   The AI Orchestrator's primary directive is to implement and expand upon this role-based model selection to ensure cost efficiency.

## 4. Identified Technical Weaknesses & Gaps

**Finding**: The reports honestly document areas where the initial implementation was weak.
*   **Context Compression**: The `avca-002-stage3` report explicitly states that the initial text compression algorithm was ineffective and needed to be replaced, possibly with an LLM-based summarization approach.
*   **Token Prediction**: The same report notes that token prediction was still using estimations in some cases and needed to be improved.

**Insight for Roadmap 2**:
*   When we implement **Task 2.1.3 (Enhance Context Manager)**, we must address these known issues. We should not reuse the failed compression algorithm and should prioritize the implementation of more accurate token counting/prediction.

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendation

The recovered reports are invaluable. They provide a "builder's diary" that gives us a much richer understanding of *why* the system is the way it is.

**Recommendation**:
1.  **Prioritize Performance Testing**: Add specific performance and cost benchmark validation to `Roadmap-3`.
2.  **Enforce Architectural Patterns**: Ensure all new DIAS services in `Roadmap-2` adhere to the established resilience and cost-optimization patterns.
3.  **Address Known Weaknesses**: Directly address the documented failures (e.g., context compression) when implementing the relevant modules in `Roadmap-2`.
