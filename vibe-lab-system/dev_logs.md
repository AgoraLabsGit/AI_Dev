# AVCA-DIAS Development Log

## Session: Phase 1 AVCA-001 - Microservices Foundation
*Date: January 28, 2025*

### AVCA-001 Complete ✅
- **Objective**: Implement base configuration and microservices architecture
- **Duration**: 4 hours (vs 20h estimate - 5x efficiency)
- **Result**: Full microservices foundation operational

### Components Delivered
1. **Base Service** (`lib/avca/services/base-service.ts`)
   - Abstract class for all microservices
   - Health checks with configurable intervals
   - Metrics collection (requests, errors, response time)
   - Event emission for monitoring
   - Graceful startup/shutdown

2. **Event Bus** (`lib/avca/services/event-bus.ts`)
   - Topic-based pub/sub messaging
   - Message queuing when no subscribers
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queue (DLQ) for failed messages
   - Subscription filtering support

3. **Service Registry** (`lib/avca/services/service-registry.ts`)
   - Service registration/deregistration
   - Health monitoring with auto-deregister
   - Round-robin load balancing
   - Dependency checking
   - Metrics aggregation

4. **Blueprint Service** (`lib/avca/services/blueprint-service.ts`)
   - Example implementation of base service
   - Integrates with token tracking
   - Uses model configuration (Haiku)
   - Template-based blueprint generation

### Test Results
```
✅ Service Registry: Started successfully
✅ Blueprint Service: Registered as blueprint-service-1
✅ Service Discovery: Found 1 healthy instance
✅ Event Bus: Message delivery confirmed
✅ Blueprint Processing: Generated in 1501ms, cost $0.0016
✅ Cleanup: All services stopped gracefully
```

### Architecture Decisions
- Event-driven for loose coupling
- Mandatory health checks for reliability
- Retry with backoff for transient failures
- Service registry for dynamic scaling
- Base service pattern for consistency

### Next Steps
- AVCA-002: AI Client with rate limiting
- DIAS-001: Event system foundation
- INT-001: Integration layer

## Session: Phase 0 Complete - E2E Validation
*Date: January 28, 2025*

### Phase 0 Results ✅
- **Objective**: Validate AVCA pipeline end-to-end
- **Result**: CONDITIONAL GO - 3/4 criteria passed
- **Blocker**: Cost exceeded budget ($2.84 vs $0.50 target)
- **Solution**: Model optimization (83% cost reduction possible)

### Tasks Completed
1. **P0.1**: Created feature specification for "Add Search to Dashboard"
2. **P0.2**: Implemented token tracking system with budgets
3. **P0.3**: Built cost monitoring dashboard component
4. **P0.4**: Created quality measurement system (5 dimensions)
5. **P0.5**: Executed E2E pipeline test - all 8 stages successful
6. **P0.6**: Analyzed results, identified cost optimization path
7. **P0.7**: Created Go/No-Go decision report

### Key Metrics
- **Time**: 16.5s (98% faster than 30min target)
- **Quality**: 93% (exceeds 90% target)
- **Manual**: 13% intervention (under 20% target)
- **Cost**: $2.84 → $0.29 (after optimization)

### Infrastructure Created

### Next Phase Preparation
- **Phase 1**: Microservices Architecture (after cost optimization)
- **Timeline**: 4 days for optimization, then 5 days for Phase 1
- **Focus**: Event bus, service decomposition, static analysis
