# 06 - Vibe Lab Security Master Blueprint
**Security Patterns, Compliance, and Protection Standards**

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization Architecture

### Authentication Strategy
```typescript
interface AuthenticationSecurity {
  provider: {
    primary: "GitHub OAuth via NextAuth.js";
    reasoning: "Developer-focused audience, repository access required";
    implementation: "NextAuth.js with secure session management";
  };
  
  sessionManagement: {
    type: "JWT-based sessions";
    storage: "Secure httpOnly cookies";
    duration: "7 days with sliding expiration";
    encryption: "JWE encryption for sensitive session data";
  };
  
  multiFactorAuth: {
    status: "Future enhancement";
    implementation: "GitHub 2FA requirement for sensitive operations";
  };
}
```

### Authorization Model
```typescript
interface AuthorizationSecurity {
  model: "Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)";
  
  roles: {
    owner: {
      permissions: ["read", "write", "delete", "deploy", "invite"];
      scope: "Full project access";
    };
    collaborator: {
      permissions: ["read", "write", "comment"];
      scope: "Project development access";
    };
    viewer: {
      permissions: ["read", "comment"];
      scope: "Read-only project access";
    };
  };
  
  enforcement: {
    api: "Middleware-based permission checking";
    ui: "Component-level access control";
    database: "Row-level security with Prisma";
  };
}
```

## 2. Data Security & Privacy

### Data Classification
```typescript
interface DataSecurity {
  classification: {
    public: {
      examples: ["Project names", "Public repository data"];
      protection: "Standard encryption in transit";
    };
    internal: {
      examples: ["User preferences", "Project metadata"];
      protection: "Encryption in transit + access control";
    };
    confidential: {
      examples: ["Private repository content", "AI usage analytics"];
      protection: "Encryption in transit + at rest + strict access control";
    };
    restricted: {
      examples: ["Authentication tokens", "API keys"];
      protection: "Vault storage + rotation + audit logging";
    };
  };
}
```

### Input Validation & Sanitization
```typescript
interface InputSecurity {
  validation: {
    api: "Zod schema validation for all API inputs";
    frontend: "Client-side validation + server-side verification";
    database: "Parameterized queries + ORM protection";
  };
  
  sanitization: {
    userContent: "DOMPurify for any user-generated HTML";
    uploads: "File type validation + virus scanning";
    codeGeneration: "Validate AI-generated code for security issues";
  };
  
  rateLimiting: {
    api: "Per-user rate limiting (100 requests/minute)";
    ai: "AI usage limits to prevent abuse";
    auth: "Login attempt limiting (5 attempts/15 minutes)";
  };
}
```

## 3. AI Security Considerations

### AI System Security
```typescript
interface AISecurity {
  inputValidation: {
    userPrompts: "Sanitize and validate all user inputs to AI agents";
    contextInjection: "Prevent prompt injection attacks";
    dataLeakage: "Ensure user data isolation in AI contexts";
  };
  
  outputValidation: {
    codeGeneration: "Scan generated code for security vulnerabilities";
    contentFiltering: "Filter inappropriate or malicious AI responses";
    compliance: "Ensure AI output meets security standards";
  };
  
  usage: {
    monitoring: "Log all AI interactions for security review";
    costControl: "Prevent AI usage abuse with limits";
    auditTrail: "Maintain audit trail of AI decisions";
  };
}
```

### AI Agent Isolation
```typescript
interface AIAgentSecurity {
  contextIsolation: {
    userSeparation: "Isolate user contexts in AI interactions";
    projectSeparation: "Prevent cross-project data leakage";
    sessionManagement: "Secure AI session management";
  };
  
  accessControl: {
    permissions: "AI agents operate with minimal required permissions";
