# Roadmap 3: AI System Testing & Validation
**Goal**: To create a comprehensive test suite that validates the functionality, resilience, and intelligence of the Vibe Lab AI systems after the core DIAS implementation from Roadmap 2 is complete.

---

## 1. Phase 1: Foundational Testing

**Objective**: To establish a baseline of tests for the new DIAS services and their integration with AVCA.

*   **[ ] Task 1.1: Test DIAS Service Wrappers**
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for the `SuperClaudeService`, validating persona activation, command execution, and flag processing.
    *   [ ] Write unit tests for the `TaskMasterService`, validating task parsing, analysis, and status updates.
*   **[ ] Task 1.2: Test AVCA/DIAS Integration**
    *   [ ] Create integration tests to validate that events from AVCA components correctly trigger DIAS services.
    *   [ ] Create integration tests to ensure commands from DIAS correctly control the AVCA pipeline.

## 2. Phase 2: E2E & Intelligence Testing

**Objective**: To perform end-to-end testing of AI-driven workflows and validate the "intelligence" of the SuperClaude framework.

*   **[ ] Task 2.1: Create E2E Tests for AI-Driven Workflows**
    *   [ ] Use the `Playwright` MCP server to write an E2E test covering the full "Design → Build → Iterate" loop.
    *   [ ] Develop specific E2E tests for features like terminal error detection and the resources module, driven by the SuperClaude `ErrorIntelligence` and `Context7` capabilities.
*   **[ ] Task 2.2: Develop Intelligence Validation Tests**
    *   [ ] Create a suite of tests with known inputs to validate the accuracy of the SuperClaude framework's recommendations (e.g., does it pick the right persona for a task?).
    *   [ ] Test the DIAS `LearningSystem` by providing feedback and verifying that the SuperClaude service adapts its behavior.

## 3. Phase 3: Final System Validation

**Objective**: To perform a final, holistic validation of the entire system.

*   **[ ] Task 3.1: Execute Full System Test**
    *   [ ] Run all unit, integration, and E2E tests to ensure complete coverage.
    *   [ ] Perform manual, exploratory testing.
*   **[ ] Task 3.2: System Bootstrap Test**
    *   [ ] Attempt to bootstrap the AVCA/DIAS pipeline using only the information from our newly refined `/Docs`. This is a critical test of the `Context7` server's ability to understand our documentation.
*   **[ ] Task 3.3: Document and Review Results**
    *   [ ] Document the results of all tests in a comprehensive report.
    *   [ ] Review the results and make any final adjustments or bug fixes.
