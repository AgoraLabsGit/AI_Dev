# BitAgora Payment Testing Checklist
## Comprehensive Testing Framework for All Payment Methods

**Date:** July 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION-TESTED  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Based on:** Lightning Payment Success + Transaction Management System

## 🎯 **Testing Overview**

This checklist ensures **comprehensive testing** of all payment processing functionality across all supported payment methods. Each test validates the critical patterns we've established through our Lightning implementation.

### **Critical Testing Areas:**
- ✅ **Payment Generation** - User-triggered, no auto-generation
- ✅ **Payment Monitoring** - 2-second polling, proper termination
- ✅ **Refund Processing** - Smart detection, amount validation
- ✅ **Transaction Management** - Timeout, cancellation, state management
- ✅ **UI/UX Flow** - Clean state management, error handling
- ✅ **Performance** - Memory leaks, API efficiency
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful failures, user feedback

- [x] **VERIFY:** Status checks every 2 seconds (not 5 seconds):
  ```bash
  🔍 Checking Strike invoice status: [invoice-id]
  🔄 Strike API request: GET /invoices/[invoice-id]
  ✅ Invoice status: UNPAID
  ```
- [x] **VERIFY:** Time remaining countdown updates in real-time
- [x] **VERIFY:** Status bar shows "⏳ Waiting for payment... XXXs"

#### **Payment Completion**
- [x] Pay Lightning invoice with test wallet
- [x] **VERIFY:** Status changes to "✅ Payment received! Processing..."
- [x] **VERIFY:** Console shows "🛑 TERMINAL STATE DETECTED - stopping monitoring"
- [x] **VERIFY:** "Complete Transaction" button appears
- [x] **VERIFY:** No further API calls after completion:
  ```bash
  🧹 CLEANUP COMPLETE - all monitoring stopped
  🚫 No further API calls should occur
  ```

#### **Monitoring Termination (CRITICAL)**
- [x] Generate Lightning invoice, then close modal
- [x] **VERIFY:** Console shows "🛑 Modal closed - stopping all monitoring immediately"
- [x] **VERIFY:** No continued API calls after modal close

### **💸 Refund Testing**

#### **Lightning Address Refunds**
- [x] Complete Lightning transaction
- [x] Open admin transactions page
- [x] Click "Refund" button - **VERIFY:** Lightning refund panel opens
- [x] Select "Address" method and enter valid Lightning address
- [x] **VERIFY:** Console shows refund processing:
  ```bash
  💸 Processing Lightning refund for transaction: [id]
  💸 Refund method: lightning_address
  🔄 Strike API request: POST /payment-quotes/lightning/lnurl
  ✅ Lightning refund sent successfully
  ```

#### **Lightning Invoice Refunds**
- [x] Generate variable amount Lightning invoice for testing
- [x] Select "Invoice" method in refund panel
- [x] **VERIFY:** BOLT11 invoice parsing works correctly:
  ```bash
  🔍 Invoice amount detection: 1p detected as parsing error - Variable amount invoice
  💸 Adding request amount to variable invoice: X.XX USD
  ```
- [x] **VERIFY:** Fixed amount invoices detected correctly:
  ```bash
  🔍 Invoice amount detection: 12500n (1250 sats) - Fixed amount invoice
  🔍 Invoice amount extraction: 12500n = 1250 sats = $X.XX USD
  ```

#### **Refund Destination Tracking**
- [x] Complete Lightning refund (any method)
- [x] **VERIFY:** Transaction details modal shows refund destination
- [x] **VERIFY:** Copy-to-clipboard functionality works
- [x] **VERIFY:** Refund audit trail includes:
  ```
  📍 Refund sent to: [lightning-address or invoice]
  💰 Amount: $X.XX
  🏢 Method: lightning_address | lightning_invoice
  ```
