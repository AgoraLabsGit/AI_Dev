## **Hack: Recreating UI/UX from Existing Websites**

**Goal**: To quickly build a new component by using an existing website as a high-fidelity design reference. This is not for copying code, but for translating a design concept into our system's patterns.

### **Procedure**

1.  **Provide the Target**: The human operator provides the AI with a URL and a specific element to recreate.
    > **Human Prompt Example**: "I want to build a product card component. Use the design of the cards on `https://example.com/products` as a reference for the layout, styling, and hover effects."

2.  **AI Performs "Digital Reconnaissance"**: The AI uses browser integration tools to analyze the target website.
    *   **Action**: Inspect the DOM to understand the HTML structure and semantic layout.
    *   **Action**: Analyze the computed CSS properties to understand the styling (colors, fonts, spacing, flexbox/grid).
    *   **Action**: Observe the functionality by analyzing any relevant client-side JavaScript.

3.  **AI Performs "Pattern Translation"**: The AI takes the conceptual information and implements it **using our system's standards**.
    *   **Action**: Build a new React component with `PascalCase` naming.
    *   **Action**: Style the component using `Tailwind CSS` utility classes, matching the visual design but not copying the original CSS.
    *   **Action**: Implement the functionality using our project's hooks and state management patterns.
    *   **Action**: Create a `Tier-2` documentation file for the new component, making it a reusable pattern.

### **Key Principle**

The goal is **inspiration, not imitation**. We are using the web as an infinite library of design ideas and translating them into our own high-quality, standardized component library.
