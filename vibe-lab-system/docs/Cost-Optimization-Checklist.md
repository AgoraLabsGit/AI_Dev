# Cost Optimization Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Implementation checklist for integrating Phase 0 cost optimization learnings into the AVCA-DIAS system foundation architecture.

**Target**: Reduce cost per pipeline run from $2.84 to $0.48 (83% reduction)  
**Method**: Stage-based Claude model selection  
**Quality Requirement**: Maintain >90% test coverage and 0 security issues  

## Pre-Implementation

### Phase 0 Analysis Review
- [ ] Review Phase 0 cost analysis report (`vibe-lab-product/lib/avca/cost-analysis-report.ts`)
- [ ] Validate current cost breakdown by pipeline stage
- [ ] Confirm token usage patterns match expectations
- [ ] Verify quality metrics baseline (90%+ coverage, 0 security issues)

### Pricing Validation
- [ ] Confirm current Claude model pricing:
  - [ ] Claude-3-Opus: $15 input / $75 output per 1M tokens
  - [ ] Claude-3-Sonnet: $3 input / $15 output per 1M tokens  
  - [ ] Claude-3-Haiku: $0.25 input / $1.25 output per 1M tokens
- [ ] Calculate projected savings for each pipeline stage
- [ ] Validate target cost of $0.48 per pipeline run

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up cost tracking per pipeline stage
- [ ] Configure cost monitoring alerts:
  - [ ] Warning at $0.60 per pipeline run (25% over target)
  - [ ] Critical at $0.75 per pipeline run (56% over target)
- [ ] Implement cost projection dashboard
- [ ] Create rollback cost monitoring

## Implementation Steps

### AI Client Enhancement
- [ ] Update AI client interface to support `stage` parameter
- [ ] Implement `OptimizedAIClient.selectModel()` method with stage-based logic
- [ ] Add fallback to complexity-based selection when stage not provided
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing role-based selection

### Model Selection Logic
- [ ] Implement stage-based model mapping:
  - [ ] `PipelineStage.CODE_GENERATION` → claude-3-sonnet-20240229
  - [ ] `PipelineStage.PAGE_DESIGNS` → claude-3-sonnet-20240229
  - [ ] `PipelineStage.IDEATION` → claude-3-sonnet-20240229
  - [ ] `PipelineStage.REGISTRY` → claude-3-haiku-20240307
  - [ ] `PipelineStage.ASSEMBLY` → claude-3-haiku-20240307
  - [ ] `PipelineStage.VERIFICATION` → claude-3-opus-20240229 (quality critical)

### Pipeline Stage Configuration
- [ ] Update Blueprint Service to use Sonnet for page designs
- [ ] Update Generation Service to use Sonnet for code generation
- [ ] Update Assembly Service to use Haiku for assembly tasks
- [ ] Keep Auditor Service using Opus for verification
- [ ] Ensure Router Service continues using Haiku

### Cost Tracking Integration
- [ ] Add cost tracking per AI request with model and stage metadata
- [ ] Implement cost aggregation per pipeline run
- [ ] Create cost reporting per project and user
- [ ] Add real-time cost monitoring with thresholds

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create test pipeline run with new model selection
- [ ] Execute end-to-end test with cost tracking enabled
- [ ] Validate cost reduction achieved (target: <$0.50 per run)
- [ ] Confirm quality metrics maintained:
  - [ ] >90% test coverage
  - [ ] 0 security issues
  - [ ] <5% time impact increase
- [ ] Test rollback capability to previous model selection

## Validation Criteria

### Cost Validation
- [ ] **Primary**: Cost per pipeline run ≤ $0.48
- [ ] **Secondary**: 80%+ cost reduction from baseline ($2.84)
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Cost tracking accurate within 5%
- [ ] **Alerting**: Cost overrun alerts functional

### Quality Validation  
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% unit test coverage
- [ ] **Security**: 0 security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] **Functionality**: All pipeline stages complete successfully
- [ ] **Performance**: <5% increase in total pipeline time

### Operational Validation
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Cost dashboards displaying accurate data
- [ ] **Alerting**: Cost threshold alerts triggering correctly  
- [ ] **Rollback**: Rollback to previous model selection tested
- [ ] **Documentation**: Implementation documented for operations team

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Cost per pipeline run exceeds $0.75 (56% over target)
- [ ] Quality metrics drop below 85% test coverage
- [ ] Security issues introduced by model changes
- [ ] Pipeline failure rate increases >5%

### Rollback Steps
- [ ] Revert AI client model selection to role-based only
- [ ] Disable stage-based model override logic
- [ ] Restore previous model configurations:
  - [ ] Developer role: claude-3-opus-20240229
  - [ ] Auditor role: claude-3-opus-20240229  
  - [ ] Router role: claude-3-haiku-20240307
- [ ] Validate rollback completes within 15 minutes
- [ ] Confirm cost returns to previous baseline
- [ ] Document rollback reason and learnings

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Targets
- [ ] **Cost Reduction**: ≥80% reduction from $2.84 baseline
- [ ] **Target Cost**: ≤$0.48 per pipeline run
- [ ] **Quality Maintenance**: >90% test coverage maintained
- [ ] **Security**: 0 security issues introduced
- [ ] **Performance**: <5% impact on pipeline execution time

### Operational Targets  
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Real-time cost visibility across all stages
- [ ] **Alerting**: Proactive cost overrun detection and alerting
- [ ] **Rollback**: <15 minute rollback capability tested and verified
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete implementation and operational docs

### Strategic Targets
- [ ] **Foundation Integration**: Cost optimization built into Phase 1 architecture
- [ ] **Scalability**: Cost model scales with increased usage
- [ ] **Sustainability**: Cost efficiency maintained as system evolves
- [ ] **Learning Integration**: Phase 0 insights integrated into system design

## Post-Implementation

### Monitoring & Optimization
- [ ] Monitor cost trends for first 2 weeks post-implementation
