# Key Learnings from Vibe Lab Development

## Cost Optimization Learnings

### Model Selection Impact
**Learning**: Model choice has a 10x impact on cost
- Claude Opus: ~$0.10-0.15 per complex task
- Claude Sonnet: ~$0.01-0.03 per task (70% cheaper)
- Claude Haiku: ~$0.0003 per task (99% cheaper)

**Application**: Use the right model for the right task
- Haiku: Routing, classification, simple checks
- Sonnet: Code generation, complex logic, reviews
- Opus: Critical security validation, high-stakes decisions

### Token Usage Patterns
**Learning**: Different pipeline stages have predictable token patterns
- Blueprints: 2,000-3,000 tokens
- Code Generation: 3,000-5,000 tokens
- Verification: 1,500-3,000 tokens
- Assembly: 500-1,000 tokens

**Application**: Pre-allocate token budgets per stage

## Development Velocity Insights

### AI-Assisted Development Speed
**Learning**: Consistently achieving 3-5x faster development
- Pattern recognition reduces boilerplate
- AI handles repetitive tasks
- Human focuses on architecture/decisions

**Limiting Factors**:
- Context window management
- AI response time
- Human review bottleneck

### Effective Task Decomposition
**Learning**: Smaller, focused tasks complete faster
- 2-6 hour tasks optimal
- Clear success criteria essential
- Testable deliverables required

## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Benefits
**Learning**: Events provide exceptional visibility
- Natural audit trail
- Easy debugging
- Performance monitoring built-in
- Loose coupling enables parallel work

**Trade-offs**:
- Initial complexity higher
- Message ordering considerations
- Dead letter queue management

### Microservices in Practice
**Learning**: Start with a few, well-defined services
- Base service pattern reduces duplication
- Service registry enables scaling
- Health checks prevent cascading failures

**Challenges**:
- Inter-service communication overhead
- Distributed transaction complexity
- Debugging across services

## Resilience Engineering

### Rate Limiting Strategies
**Learning**: Token buckets > fixed windows
- Handles burst traffic gracefully
- Fair resource allocation
- Predictable behavior under load

**Key Metrics**:
- Burst factor: 1.5-2x works well
- Refill rate: Match provider limits
- Queue timeout: 30s reasonable

### Retry Logic Effectiveness
**Learning**: Smart retries prevent most failures
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd
- Jitter (20%) spreads retry attempts
- Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures

**Success Rates**:
- 1 retry: Catches 70% of transient failures
- 2 retries: Catches 90% of transient failures
- 3 retries: Diminishing returns

## Testing Strategies

### E2E Testing Value
**Learning**: Early E2E tests catch systemic issues
- Cost problems identified immediately
- Performance bottlenecks visible
- Integration issues exposed

**Best Practices**:
- Simulate realistic workloads
- Track all key metrics
- Automate result analysis

### Component Testing ROI
**Learning**: Focused tests provide rapid feedback
- Unit tests: Catch 60% of bugs
- Integration tests: Catch 30% of bugs
- E2E tests: Catch final 10%

**Time Investment**:
- Unit tests: 10% of dev time
- Integration tests: 20% of dev time
- E2E tests: 10% of dev time

## Documentation Evolution

### Living Documentation
**Learning**: Multiple views serve different needs
- Executive summary for stakeholders
- Technical details for developers
- Progress tracking for project management

**Maintenance Strategy**:
- Update immediately after milestones
- Automate where possible
- Review weekly for accuracy

### Meta-Documentation Value
**Learning**: Documenting the process improves it
- Patterns become visible
- Improvements emerge naturally
- Knowledge transfers efficiently

## AI Integration Insights

### Context Management Critical
**Learning**: Context isolation prevents contamination
- Role-specific contexts improve quality
- Token limits force clarity
- Sliding windows maintain coherence

**Optimal Limits**:
- Developer: 150k tokens (comprehensive)
- Auditor: 50k tokens (focused)
- Router: 5k tokens (minimal)

### Model Behavior Patterns
**Learning**: Each model has strengths
- Haiku: Fast, deterministic, great for structured tasks
- Sonnet: Balanced, creative, handles complexity
- Opus: Thorough, catches edge cases, expensive

## Performance Optimization

### Token Prediction Accuracy
**Learning**: Estimation within 20% is achievable
- Character count * 0.25 = rough tokens
- Code tends toward 0.3 ratio
- Comments toward 0.2 ratio

### Caching Opportunities
**Learning**: Not all contexts need regeneration
- Static project info: Cache indefinitely
- Recent changes: Cache 5 minutes
- Active edits: No caching

## Future Improvements

### Identified Gaps
1. **Monitoring Dashboard**: CLI-only currently limits visibility
2. **Load Testing**: Haven't validated at scale
3. **Token Counting**: Using estimates vs actual
4. **Context Optimization**: No compression/summarization

### Emerging Patterns
1. **Staged Rollouts**: Gradual feature enablement works
2. **Conservative Defaults**: Start safe, optimize later
3. **Measurement First**: Can't improve what you don't measure
