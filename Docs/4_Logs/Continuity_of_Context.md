### **Last Updated: August 4, 2025**

#### **Current Goal**
The immediate objective is to manage ESLint issues strategically while preparing for the full AI implementation described in Roadmap-9. The current ESLint status is 2,893 issues (935 errors, 1,958 warnings).

#### **Current Status**

*   **Project Structure Consolidated**: Successfully migrated critical files from `lib_old` to proper locations, removing duplicate directory structure.
*   **ESLint Foundation Established**: Created `development-friendly.ts` with flexible type system to support both current cleanup and future AI implementation.
*   **Critical Infrastructure Preserved**: Recovered `health-aware-router.ts` and `service-manager.ts` - essential for AVCA staged initialization.
*   **Documentation Updated**: Added "Code Quality Maintenance" section to Roadmap-9 documenting remaining ESLint issues and phased cleanup strategy.
*   **TypeScript Errors Resolved**: Previous session's 282 TypeScript errors have been addressed; project compiles successfully.

#### **Next Steps**

1.  **Begin Roadmap-9 Implementation**: Start Phase 1 (Core DIAS Intelligence Architecture) focusing on AI Orchestrator and MCP Server Integration.
2.  **Address ESLint Issues Strategically**: Fix type safety issues as we implement new AI features, following the phased approach documented in Roadmap-9.
3.  **Implement Missing AI Components**: Work through the comprehensive list of 38 missing AI system components identified in the audit.
