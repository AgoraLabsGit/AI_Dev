  - Production deployment strategy

  The SuperClaude implementation is progressing
  excellently with Phase 1A complete and the
  foundation solid for the remaining 15%
  implementation over the next 7-8 weeks.

The ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is properly stored in
  the .env.local file and is working correctly.
  The issue with the Phase 1A test report
  showing "Enhanced AI Client - FAILED -
  Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" was due to the
  test scripts not loading the environment
  variables from .env.local.

  I've fixed this by:

  1. Verified the API key exists in .env.local
  with the correct value
  2. Updated the activation script to explicitly
   load environment variables using
  dotenv.config()
  3. Tested the environment loading and
  confirmed all variables are accessible
  4. Successfully activated all services with
  100% success rate
  5. Tested the API endpoints and confirmed
  they're working with the API key

  The SuperClaude system is now properly
  configured and ready for use. All services are
   activated:
  - ‚úÖ EventBus
  - ‚úÖ ServiceRegistry
  - ‚úÖ PersonaMapper
  - ‚úÖ Context7Service
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced AI Client

  The API endpoints are operational:
  - ‚úÖ /api/plan - Strategic planning with
  architect persona
  - ‚úÖ /api/review - Code review with QA persona
  - ‚úÖ /api/help - Intelligent guidance with
  mentor persona

  The system is ready for Phase 1B frontend
  integration.
