# Continuity of Context

This document provides a snapshot of the current development context to ensure seamless handover between work sessions.

### **Last Updated: August 5, 2025**

#### **Current Goal**

The primary objective of this session was to finalize the documentation migration initiative by processing all remaining legacy documentation directories (`vibe-lab-docs(old)` and `organize2&2clean-2`). The goal was to consolidate all essential information into the new `/Docs` structure, delete the old files, and establish a clear, up-to-date project status.

#### **Current Status**

*   **Documentation Migration Complete**: The systematic review and migration of all legacy documentation is now finished. The `vibe-lab-docs(old)` directory has been deleted, and while `organize2&2clean-2` remains due to a permissions issue, all valuable content has been extracted from it. The `/Docs` directory is now the comprehensive and authoritative source of truth for the project.

*   **Key Integrations from Final Migration**:
    *   **Historical Development Logs**: All previous development logs have been merged into the main `Docs/4_Logs/Development_Log.md`, providing a complete, chronological history of the project.
    *   **Future Feature Ideas**: High-level concepts for "Magic UI Optimization" and "Targeted Enhancement Features" have been captured in `Docs/1_Project/Roadmap_and_Tasks/03_Future_Feature_Ideas.md`.
    *   **Blueprint Process**: The methodology for creating and tracking blueprints has been documented in `Docs/3_Process/Blueprint_Development_Process.md`.

*   **Housekeeping**:
    *   Deleted `github_vibe_lab`.
    *   Deleted `vibe-lab-docs(old)`.
    *   All valuable content from `organize2&2clean-2` has been migrated. The directory itself cannot be deleted due to a file system permission error.

#### **Immediate Next Steps**

1.  **Review `vibe-lab-meta`**: With the main documentation migration complete, the next logical step is to review the `vibe-lab-meta` directory for any remaining valuable information that should be integrated into the `/Docs` structure.
2.  **Pre-launch Tasks**: Review the `Pre-launch-tasks.md` file to align on the final steps before launch.
