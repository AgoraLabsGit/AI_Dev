1.6 GitHub Saving via Claude Command
1.7 Protocols (when to save to push updates to gitHub Repo, update COC/devLogs, error logs, etc)
1.8 Discuss Atomic System. Does our current document do a good enough job at emphasisizng the idea of building out the front and back end application code as atmoic units? Is this an outdated and unuseful concept or should we lean into it more?
