# System Intelligence Audit

**Objective**: To perform a comprehensive audit of the Vibe Lab codebase against its documented system intelligence features. This document serves as a checklist to track the presence and completeness of each feature.

    *   [/] Features "Advanced Component Configuration" wizard (partially implemented through pattern detection).
*   **[x] Code Generator**:
    *   [x] Generates code files (`.tsx`, `.test.tsx`, `.stories.tsx`).
    *   [x] Uses "Magic Component Pipeline" (MCP) for variations (implemented through file type generation).
*   **[x] Quality Assurance**:
    *   [x] Validates TypeScript.
    *   [x] Removes unused imports.
    *   [x] Applies performance optimizations (`React.memo`).
    *   [x] Calculates a final quality score.
    *   [x] Enforces quality gates (coverage, security, performance, accessibility, TS strictness).

### 1.2. Staged Initialization

*   **[x] `ServiceManager`**:
    *   [x] Manages service lifecycles.
    *   [/] Implements circuit breaker protection (partially implemented through timeouts and retries).
    *   [x] Has a 5-second timeout.
*   **[x] `HealthAwareRouter`**:
    *   [x] Routes to primary or fallback services.
    *   [x] Enables graceful degradation.
*   **[x] Staged Loading**:
    *   [x] Stage 1 (0-1s): EventBus.
    *   [x] Stage 2 (1-5s): AI Client, Blueprint Service.
    *   [x] Stage 3 (5-30s): DIAS Intelligence Engines.

### 1.3. Integration & Resilience

*   **[x] Worker Architecture**:
    *   [x] Abstract `AIWorker` class.
    *   [x] Abstract `ScriptWorker` class.
    *   [x] Abstract `HybridWorker` class.
*   **[/] Data & Event Flow**:
    *   [/] Central `PipelineData` object (partially implemented; data is passed between stages, but not as a single object).
    *   [x] Bidirectional event system between AVCA and DIAS.
*   **[ ] Resilience & Performance**:
    *   [x] Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms.
    *   [x] Configurable error recovery (retries, fallbacks, rollbacks).
    *   [ ] Intelligent caching strategy.
    *   [x] Parallel processing of tasks.

### 1.4. Component Architecture

*   **[x] Component Registry**:
    *   [x] Database for storing component versions (implemented as in-memory cache in `ComponentCatalogService`).
    *   [x] Enables versioning and dependency tracking.

## 2. DIAS (Dynamic Intelligence & Adaptation System)

### 2.1. Core Architecture

*   **[x] DIAS Event System**:
    *   [x] Pub/sub architecture.
    *   [x] Defines 6 event categories (Component, Pipeline, Quality, User, System, Integration).
*   **[ ] AI Orchestrator**:
    *   [ ] Intelligently routes requests to specialized servers.
*   **[ ] Specialized Intelligence Servers**:
    *   [ ] `Context7` (Docs/Research)
    *   [ ] `Sequential` (Deep Analysis)
    *   [ ] `Magic` (UI Generation)
    *   [ ] `Playwright` (E2E Testing)
*   **[x] Context Manager**:
    *   [x] Prepares and optimizes context for AI agents.
    *   [ ] Uses LRU cache.
    *   [ ] Uses content compression.
    *   [ ] Uses a priority-based sliding window.

### 2.2. Core Intelligence Modules

*   **[ ] Conversational Interface**:
    *   [ ] Classifies user intent from chat.
    *   [ ] Routes to the appropriate service.
    *   [ ] Integrates with Context Keeper and Memory System.
