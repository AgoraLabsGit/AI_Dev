# Roadmap 4: Legacy System Migration (V2.0)
**Goal**: To extend the Vibe Lab system with the capabilities to analyze, plan, and execute the migration of legacy codebases, powered by the SuperClaude AI framework.

---

## 1. Phase 1: Reverse AVCA Pipeline

**Objective**: To build the core components of the "Reverse AVCA Pipeline," using SuperClaude's analytical capabilities to understand existing codebases.

*   **[ ] Task 1.1: Code-to-Component Analysis**
    *   [ ] Implement a multi-language static analysis engine. The SuperClaude `architect` persona will be used to oversee this process.
*   **[ ] Task 1.2: Atomic Classification**
    *   [ ] Build a pattern recognition system. This will be an extension of the DIAS `PatternRecognitionEngine`, using the SuperClaude `Context7` server to learn from our AVCA documentation.
*   **[ ] Task 1.3: Blueprint Reconstruction**
    *   [ ] Create an AI-powered system to infer business logic. This will use the SuperClaude `Sequential` server for deep analysis.
*   **[ ] Task 1.4: Migration Planning**
    *   [ ] Develop a DIAS module to generate a migration roadmap. The SuperClaude `strategist` persona will be used to create the plan.

## 2. Phase 2: Extended DIAS Modules for Migration

**Objective**: To build the new DIAS intelligence modules required for legacy migration, all powered by the SuperClaude framework.

*   **[ ] Task 2.1: Legacy Analyzer**
    *   [ ] Implement the `LegacyAnalyzer` module, which will use a combination of SuperClaude personas (`architect`, `security-expert`) to perform a deep analysis.
*   **[ ] Task 2.2: Migration Intelligence**
    *   [ ] Build the `MigrationIntelligence` module, using the SuperClaude `strategist` persona to plan migrations.
*   **[ ] Task 2.3: Compatibility Engine**
    *   [ ] Create the `CompatibilityEngine`, which will use the SuperClaude `full-stack` persona to generate adapter components.

## 3. Phase 3: Migration Tooling & UI

**Objective**: To build the necessary tooling and user interfaces to support the migration workflow.

*   **[ ] Task 3.1: Code Archaeology System**
    *   [ ] Develop the `CodeArchaeologist`, a tool that provides a UI for the `LegacyAnalyzer` module.
*   **[ ] Task 3.2: Migration Workflow System**
    *   [ ] Implement the four-phase migration strategy, managed by the `TaskMasterService`.
*   **[ ] Task 3.3: Hybrid Component Registry**
    *   [ ] Extend the component registry to track migration status.
*   **[ ] Task 3.4: Archaeological Dashboard UI**
    *   [ ] Build a user interface to visualize the analysis from the SuperClaude-powered migration modules.
