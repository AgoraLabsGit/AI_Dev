# Master Task List: Vibe Lab Native AI Integration

**Created**: 2025-08-04  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive integrated task list combining all AI system implementation and testing phases  
**Scope**: Phases 2-4 of Native AI Integration + Complete Testing Suite

---

## Overview

This master task list integrates all tasks from the Native AI Integration roadmap and the System Testing roadmap, showing interdependencies between implementation and validation phases. Tasks are organized to enable parallel development where possible while maintaining critical path dependencies.

### SuperClaude Framework Integration Note

**As of August 2025**: The AI implementation strategy has evolved to use the SuperClaude framework as the core intelligence engine powering both AVCA and DIAS systems. This represents a hybrid architecture where:

- **AVCA** provides domain-specific component development workflows
- **DIAS** provides project-specific learning and adaptation  
- **SuperClaude** provides the underlying AI intelligence with 11 specialized personas, 4 MCP servers, and wave orchestration

**‚úÖ PHASE 1A COMPLETE**: All SuperClaude integration services successfully activated with 100% test pass rate:
- **‚úÖ PersonaMapper**: 100% operational with all 11 personas and mapping capabilities
- **‚úÖ Enhanced AI Client**: Fully configured with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY integration
- **‚úÖ Context7 MCP Service**: Structurally complete and ready for CLI integration
- **‚úÖ Build System**: All TypeScript compilation errors resolved, project builds successfully
- **‚úÖ API Endpoints**: All three endpoints (/plan, /review, /help) fully operational

**üöÄ PHASE 1B READY**: Frontend integration can now proceed safely:
- **Environment**: All feature flags configured for SuperClaude development
- **Infrastructure**: Zero-breaking-change integration confirmed
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite validates all core services

**For the comprehensive implementation plan**, see:
- **SuperClaude-TaskMaster-Implementation-Plan.md** - Complete 8-week TaskMaster approach
- **Roadmap 9: Full SuperClaude Complete AI Implementation** - Updated with integration dependencies
