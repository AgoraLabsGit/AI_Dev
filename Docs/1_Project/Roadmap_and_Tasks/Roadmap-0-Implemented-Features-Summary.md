## 1. Core AI Capabilities (AVCA-002)

The foundational services for interacting with AI models are complete.

### 1.1. AI Client Service
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: The core client for connecting to the Anthropic Claude API.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Handles the three AI roles (Developer, Auditor, Router) with specific model configurations.
    *   Manages concurrent requests.
    *   Tracks token usage and calculates costs.

### 1.2. Context Manager
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: A sophisticated system for preparing and optimizing the context sent to AI agents.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Role-based context isolation.
    *   LRU caching for performance.
    *   Priority-based sliding window to manage token limits.
    *   Accurate token counting.

### 1.3. Rate Limiter & Retry Handler
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: A resilient request handling system to manage API usage and errors.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Token bucket algorithm for rate limiting.
    *   Request queuing to handle bursts.
    *   Exponential backoff with jitter for retries.
    *   Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures.

## 2. DIAS Foundation (DIAS-001)

The core nervous system for the Dynamic Intelligence & Adaptation System is in place.

### 2.1. DIAS Event System
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: The central event bus that allows DIAS to be an event-driven, asynchronous system.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Comprehensive, strongly-typed event definitions for all major system activities.
    *   A central handler that routes events to the correct sub-systems.
    *   A built-in audit trail for observability.
    *   A dead letter queue for resilient error handling.

## 3. Integration Layer (INT-001)

The connective tissue between AVCA and DIAS has been built.

### 3.1. Worker Architecture & Manager
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: A standardized system for managing background tasks.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Abstracted `AIWorker`, `ScriptWorker`, and `HybridWorker` classes.
    *   A worker manager that handles job queues, priority, and dynamic scaling.

### 3.2. State Manager
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: A service responsible for synchronizing state across the entire platform.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Tracks project state (blueprints, components, etc.).
    *   Uses an event-driven observer pattern to keep the system in sync.
    *   Maintains a history of state changes.

## 4. Component Generation Pipeline (COMP-001)

The complete four-stage pipeline for transforming a blueprint into production-ready code is operational.

### 4.1. Stage 1: Blueprint Parser
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: Parses raw blueprint data into a structured format.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Extracts requirements, dependencies, and file structure.
    *   Calculates complexity and estimates development time.

### 4.2. Stage 2: Component Planner
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: Transforms a parsed blueprint into a detailed implementation plan.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Defines the implementation strategy and design patterns.
    *   Generates file structures, TypeScript interfaces, and a complete test plan.

### 4.3. Stage 3: Code Generator
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: Takes a component plan and generates the actual code files.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Generates multi-file components (`.tsx`, `.test.tsx`, `.stories.tsx`, etc.).
    *   Handles import management and TypeScript support.
    *   Creates skeleton code with `TODOs` for developers.

### 4.4. Stage 4: Quality Assurance
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: The final stage that validates, optimizes, and enhances the generated code.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Performs code validation, optimization, and auto-fixing.
    *   Formats code and enforces best practices.
    *   Calculates a final quality score for the component.

## 5. User-Facing Systems

### 5.1. Multi-Path Onboarding System
*   **Status**: ✅ Complete
*   **Description**: The primary user entry point for transforming ideas, code, or documentation into application blueprints.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   Four distinct entry paths (Start Fresh, GitHub Import, Code Upload, Docs Import).
    *   A split-screen interface combining a conversational AI with a real-time visual builder.
    *   Directly invokes core backend services (`OnboardingAIService`, `DocumentGeneratorService`, `BlueprintService`) at each step.
